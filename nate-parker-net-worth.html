He is a film director, producer, as well as an actor, who is probably best known for appearing in a number of TV and film titles, such as “The Great Debaters” (2007), “Red Tails” (2012), “They Die By Dawn” (2013), and “The Birth Of A Nation” (2016). He is also recognized as a wrestler. His career has been active since 2004.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Nate Parker is, as of mid- 2016? It has been estimated according to authoritative sources that the total size of Nate’s net worth is currently over $3 million, which has been accumulated through his successful career in the entertainment industry as an actor, director and producer.</p><h3>Nate Parker Net Worth $3 Million</h3><p>Nate Parker was raised with four younger sisters by a single mother Carolyn, who never married their biological father. As a child, he was very problematic, as his mother married another man and moved with him, and his biological father passed away when he was only nine years old. So he moved to Virginia, where he lived with his uncle, Jay Combs, who was a retired wrestler, so under his influence Nate began wrestling while he was at Great Bridge High School. He then attended Pennsylvania State University, but as he was accused of rape, he transferred to the University of Oklahoma, from which he later graduated with a degree in computer programming. During high school and college Nate focused more and more on wrestling, becoming one of the most successful wrestlers of his class, and he was named All-American wrestler.</p><p>However, Nate found a full-time job working as a computer programmer, but that didn`t last long, as he was soon spotted by a talent agent Jon Simmons. Nate accompanied his friend to an audition, when Simmons approached him, thinking that Nate was a model, or even actor. Nevertheless, the two immediately reached an agreement, and Nate saw himself flying to Los Angeles in no time.</p><p>He made his debut appearance in 2004 in an episode of the TV series “Cold Case”, which was soon followed by appearances in such productions as “Kurtlar Vadisi”, (2005), which is a Turkish TV series, and then made his big screen debut in the film “Cruel World” (2005), and continued in the same rhythm with a role in the film “Dirty” (2005). By 2010, he had established a name for himself, appearing in the films “Pride” (2007), “The Great Debaters” (2007), with <a href=#>Denzel Washington</a> and Forrest Whitaker in lead roles, “Felon” (2008), and “The Secret Life Of Bees” (2008) with <a href=#>Dakota Fanning</a> and <a href=#>Jennifer Hudson</a>, which added a lot to his overall wealth.</p><p>He then took a short break from acting, focusing more on directing and producing, but returned in 2012 with a role in the film “Red Tails”, and continued to appear on big screen in the films “Arbitrage” with Richard Geere and <a href=#>Susan Sarandon</a>, “Ain’t Them Bodies Saints” (2013), “Non-Stop” (2014) starring <a href=#>Liam Neeson</a> and Julienne Moore, and “Beyond The Lights” (2014), which increased his net worth by a large margin.</p><p>Most recently he featured in the films “Eden” (2015), and “Birth Of A Nation” (2016), which he directed, wrote and produced, increasing further his net worth. Nate has also been recognized as director and producer through putting his name to such films as “Ghost Team One” (2013), “Portion” (2012), and “Predilection” which is yet to be released.</p><p>Thanks to his skills, Nate has received several prestigious nominations and awards, including the AAFCA Award in the category Best Supporting Actor for his work on the film “Arbitrage”. Furthermore, he received three Image Award nominations for his work on films “Beyond The Lights”, “The Great Debaters”, and “The Secret Life Of Bees”, among many others.&nbsp;When it comes to speak about his personal life, Nate Parker has been married to his long-time girlfriend Sarah De Santo since 2007; the couple has three daughters.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=22.879781420765><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Nate Parker</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>1954-06-06</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Brooklyn, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.75&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Profession</td><td>Screenwriter, Musician, Film producer, Film director, Actor, Coach</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Pennsylvania State University, University of Oklahoma</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Sarah DiSanto</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Justice Parker</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Carolyn Parker</td></tr><tr readability=0.3265306122449><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/OrigiNateParker/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.36842105263158><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/TheTideNate</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34615384615385><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/origi_nate/?hl=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1676649/</a></td></tr><tr readability=7><td>Nominations</td><td>NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture, NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actor in a Motion Picture, NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Directing in a Motion Picture, NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Writing in a Motion Picture</td></tr><tr readability=24><td>Movies</td><td>The Birth of a Nation, Beyond the Lights, The Great Debaters, Red Tails, Non-Stop, The Secret Life of Bees, Eden, Arbitrage, About Alex, Ain't Them Bodies Saints, Pride, Every Secret Thing, Rome & Jewel, Felon, Red Hook Summer, Blood Done Sign My Name, They Die By Dawn, Tunnel Rats, #AmeriCan, Dirty...</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=16.796232876712><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>[on Nat Turner] He became my hero in college.
