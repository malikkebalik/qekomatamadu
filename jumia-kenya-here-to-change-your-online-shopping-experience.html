They have been in Kenya for just three months (launched on March 15th) and are owned by <span class=removed_link title=http://www.rocket-internet.de/whoweare>Rocket Internet</span> which is owned by two german brothers. The e-commerce company is yet to officially launch in Kenya but is making an impact by focusing on creating awareness and building a following online.</p><p>Jumia already has over 25,000 Facebook fans, receives over 30 orders daily and has 8,000 subscribers on their opt-in mailing list. The Jumia website has attract enough eye-balls with now daily hits averaging just over 10,000. With most of the shoppers in Africa not too trusting on the internet to deliver goods they bought, Jumia loves to be paid when they deliver unless they are doing up-country delivery. So they have to rely so much on&nbsp;instinct&nbsp;and analyse the psychology of its shoppers to remove cases of mistrusts.</p><p>The creative, young and innovative team of 30 professionals at Jumia also ensure that they keep up with the&nbsp;calendar&nbsp; mark important days and also have a crazy discount daily. The daily deal which is for marketing purposes see a limited number of shoppers buy one or select items on promotion at a hugely discounted rate.</p><p>Jumia works with various distributors in Kenya.</p><p>The team at Jumia has realised that men buy mostly electronics while female stuff like fashion&nbsp;accessories&nbsp;are the best selling. Samsung Galaxy S4 now dominate the buys on Jumia with iPhone 5 also being a favourite. The portal has recently updated its catalogue with more distributors brought on board.</p><p>Some of the local brands which have partnered with Jumia include TACC, Kenya International Sports Ltd, East Africa Glass Mart (distributors of Luminarc), Johari Designs, Kazuri and Redington. Product in different categories are increased on a daily basis, offering the latest trends in fashion, mobile phones and computing as well as home and living.</p><p>As part of its growth strategy, Jumia Kenya seeks to give customers the best shopping experience by ensuring they have an array of products to choose from at very competitive prices, a number of payment options that include cash on delivery, mobile money transfer and Visa or Mastercard, delivered right at your doorstep.</p><p>Jumia has a very interesting delivery process where they have partnered with Well Fargo. So when the Wells Fargo guy deliver to you something which doesn’t fit your tast, like you saw a white a phone which is better than the black one you bought or the delivered shoe doesn’t fit, you need to just hand-over the item to the Wells Fargo delivery guy and he will change it for you and deliver at no extra cost. The delivery will be done within 2 – 5 days.</p><p>Jumia is sure changing the online shopping experience. I guess that Jumia and Bid or Buy are great. I am just interested in seeing the whole process being electronic without the intervening phone calls unless there is a problem. In Africa, Jumia currently has shops for Nigeria, Morocco, Egypt and Kenya. The Nigerian online store receives over 1,000 orders in a single day. In Kenya, Rocket Internet also runs the <span class=removed_link title=https://www.hellofood.co.ke>Hello Food</span> while in South Africa they also run the <a href=#>Zando fashion online store</a>.</p><b>Email your news TIPS to Editor@kahawatungu.com or WhatsApp +254707482874</b><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmijkZ2uuK3TrqWgrV6YvK57ya6kopldoLKvxcBmn56qlWLBsHnCoZinn5VixrDB0Wamp6SZo7Juv8eop6mhnpx6psTPnqminZ6YsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
