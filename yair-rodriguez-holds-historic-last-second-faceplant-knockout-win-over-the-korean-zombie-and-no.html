The 29-year-old suffered a devastating defeat at the hands of former lightweight champion Frankie Edgar, who he simply wasn’t ready to fight in 2017.
Rodriguez proved he has the heart and skills to be a genuine title contender in his very next fight against another UFC veteran – Chan Sung Jung."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It was eye-opening for me, and I better get ready for that if I want to be the champion. If I want to be champion, I’m going to have to put in some work because he’s tough. He’s really tough,” he said.</p><p>The UFC on ABC 3 main event is a high-stakes match-up for the 145lb division. While Rodriguez can secure himself a title shot, the champion may well move up to lightweight if the Ultimate Fighter: Latin America winner is not victorious against Ortega.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraKWdlnxyfZNxb2xxX66uqr6Mq6adqpmcwqbGjKGmpZyjYrWqv9OoqaKbXaC8s7HAp2Szp52XtqZ5yqhkp6enYrWmv4yopZ5lp567bq3WmrBmnqKkum6tjKyfqKxdlsFurcuer5qmlJq%2FbsLOpaKapp%2BrwKy1jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
