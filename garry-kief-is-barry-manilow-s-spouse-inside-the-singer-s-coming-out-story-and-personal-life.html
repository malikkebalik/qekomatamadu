Shortly after graduating high school, he married Susan Deixler. However, they were together for only a year.</p><p class=Fg>He once admitted that while he was in love with Deixler, he was <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/music/macy-gray-shocked-to-find-out-her-kids-are-fans-of-her-music/>not ready</a> to tie the knot. Manilow was too young and focused on making music each night to settle down.</p><p class=Fg>In 1978, he met TV executive Garry Kief, who shortly later became his manager and lover. However, the couple kept their romance under wraps for over three decades.</p><p class=Fg>It is important to point out that the singer has always had a predominantly female fan base that used to be known as the “<a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.biography.com/musician/barry-manilow>Fanilows</a>.” As such, he considered that not revealing his sexuality was the best option.</p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>If he had shared the news of his sexuality at the beginning of his career, it would have “killed” it</strong></h3><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>MANILOW AND KIEF’S WEDDING</strong></p><p class=Fg>Barry Manilow and <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3267919/garry-kief-barry-manilows-husband-manager/>Garry Kief</a>, who is now the president of Barry Manilow Productions, secretly married in April 2014 at the singer’s home in Palm Springs, California.</p><p class=Fg>About 20 to 30 guests were invited to what they believed was a <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/barry-manilow-marries-manager-garry-kief/>lunch party</a>, but it was actually the couple’s wedding. According to Manilow, he didn’t think the ceremony would be as emotional as it was.</p><p class=Fg>He pointed out that looking at each other and saying “<a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/music/barry-manilow-emotional-wedding-garry-kief/>I love you</a>” in front of people was “deeper” than they both thought. Still, they saw the ceremony as a formality as they’ve considered themselves a married couple all these years.</p><p class=Fg>When the news of Barry Manilow and Garry Kief’s wedding was announced, <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/barry-manilows-ex-wife-really-happy-for-singer-as-he-weds-manager-garry-kief-31136041.html>Susan Deixler</a>, the singer’s ex-wife, said she was “really happy” for him and wished the couple all the best.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>COMING OUT PUBLICLY</strong></p><p class=Fg>In 2015, news of their romance made headlines. When people found out, they were “so happy,” as strangers would comment, “<a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/music/macy-gray-shocked-to-find-out-her-kids-are-fans-of-her-music/>great for you</a>,” making Manilow feel grateful.</p><p class=Fg>The singer only publicly came out as gay in 2017 at 73 during an interview with People, saying that he thought he could <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/music/macy-gray-shocked-to-find-out-her-kids-are-fans-of-her-music/>disappoint</a> fans if he came out.</p><p class=Fg>Manilow, who said that being gay became “ok a couple of years ago,” pointed out that if he had shared the news of his sexuality at the beginning of his career, it would have “<a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/18/barry-manilow-glad-to-be-be-gay-without-trying-to-sell-something>killed</a>” it immediately.</p><p class=Fg>He later admitted that, when he became a famous musician, his friends, family, and band members knew that he was gay and that the topic didn’t really <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/29ehI8lgHQE>bother him</a> anymore.</p><p class=Fg>Still, he didn’t share the news publicly because he’s just a private person.
