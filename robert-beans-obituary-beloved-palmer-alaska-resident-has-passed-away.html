In light of the unexpected passing of Robert, his family has come to the conclusion that the GoFundMe money should be used to cover the costs of his funeral.</p><p>During this challenging time, we would like to express our deepest gratitude to everyone who has offered their prayers, made supportive phone calls, and sent supportive notes to us. Our hearts, which are broken, have found refuge and comfort in the warmth and compassion that you have shown to us.</p><p>We will be preparing memorial ceremonies to commemorate Robert’s life as we make our way through the arduous journey of grief. While we get together to pay tribute to his memory and seek comfort in one another’s company, we politely beg for your understanding and patience.</p><p>Let us use this opportunity to reflect on the love, humor, and joy that Robert brought into our lives during this difficult time. His legacy will continue to live on in our hearts forever, and his memory will continue to motivate us to savor the time we spend with the people we care about the most in this world.</p><p>Because our brother Gunny is in the midst of the healing process following a recent event, we respectfully ask that you refrain from informing him about this post. We want him to be able to concentrate on his rehabilitation without being distracted by any stress that isn’t required. During this challenging time, I want to express my gratitude for your compassion, support, and love.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZL%2BwrsSrq2aalZa7tHnOm6CtrZGnxm6uxKWmr52UYr2iuMyeqWaZnJbArK2Mq5ysoZSau7V5x5qqZqiRqMCmsIyarpqxXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
