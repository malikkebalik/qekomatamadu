He is still in the early stages, and it will take time to start making big money. His net worth is far from some of the biggest rappers.

Nikane's other sister Kyla Madeira has also decided to make a career in the film industry.</p><p><strong>Kyla Madeira</strong> may not be as accomplished as her sister, but her career is only going uphill. Like Nikane, she lives a private life, and little is known about her.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/8/MV5BMjRmM2Y1NWQtMzllZi00MGMzLWEwZTItODk2NmMzMzk3M2RmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTc4NjczMzY@._V1_%20(1)-1670484602611.jpg><p>Her <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>IMDb</i></a> page shows her filmography is tiny compared to her sister.

Her filmography also contains <i>Yo Fam! </i>and<i> The Mystery Files</i>.</p><h2>About His Sister Kiana Madeira</h2><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Kiana Madeira</a> is an actress mostly known for her television works. The Canadian beauty hailed from Toronto and was born on <strong>November 4, 1992</strong>. She might be short in height, with the woman standing at <strong>5 Feet and 5 Inches</strong> (165 cm).&nbsp;</p><p>However, that didn't stop her from pursuing her dream of becoming an actor. She has wanted to become an actor since she watched Grease as a kid.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Her <i>IMDb</i> page says she started giving auditions when she was just 10.

Her other works are<i> Fear Street, After Ever Happy, Level 16, </i>and<i> She Never Died.</i></p><h2>Is Nikane&nbsp;In A Relationship With Anyone?&nbsp;</h2><p>If you want to learn about Nikane Madeira's relationship status, I have some bad news. His relationship status remains unknown. He has not provided any insights into his love life to the media.&nbsp;</p><p>However, his sister is very much open about her relationship in public. She is okay with sharing her love with the world. She is in love with <strong>Lovell Adams-Gray</strong>. He is no longer her boyfriend, as the two are officially engaged.</p><p>Like her, her fiancée is also an actor. He is popularly known for his role as <i>Dru Tejada</i> from <i>Power Book II: Ghost</i>. Plus, he is also a Canadian like her. She is usually posting about Lovell on her Instagram. In one of her posts, she showed how much she loved her man. She wrote:</p><p>Four years ago this handsome angel asked me to be his girlfriend. I have since been promoted to fiancée; one of my dearest promotions to this day I hope everyone is experiencing love and light today and everyday this year. “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it.” (John 1:5)&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/8/135731457_857572228407718_2511091050817781892_n%20(1)-1670484040386.jpg><h2>Where Is Nikane Today? Has He Quit Music?</h2><p>Nikane has been quiet for a while now. He was actively working in 2021. The same thing can't be said about this year, however. This has led to some speculations. He could be on a hiatus from music and could come back later, or he might have given up on making music.</p><p>Nikane&nbsp;has not made music for a while. Not only that, but he has also deleted his Instagram account. This is the primary reason behind the speculations. He has stepped away from the media, so no one knows what he is up to nowadays.&nbsp;</p><h2>His Relationship With Sister Kiana (They Are Twins)</h2><p>In case you didn't know, the brother and sister are twins. But they were not born on the same date, though. Nikane Madeira was born on March 2, whereas Kiana Madeira&nbsp;was born on November 4. His age may be unknown, but he is the older of the two.</p><p>The two have lots of love and respect for one another. Kiana, especially, has called his brother always inspires her to do better, and she does the same. In her Insta on October 7, 2020, Kiana, while promoting her brother's new music, wrote:</p><p>My brother has taught me the importance of mastering my craft. Since day 1, he has been setting the bar high and we continue to rise together. @nikaneisefflo new music coming this month I LOVE YOU BIG BRO</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2022/12/8/Screenshot_20221208_130927%20(1)-1670484330706.jpg><h2>He Has A Mixed Ethnicity (About His Parents)</h2><p>Nikane Madeira is from Canada, but his ethnicity is vast. His ancestors go back to a lot of different places. So, what is Nikane made up of? He is Half Portuguese, Half First Nations, Half Irish, and Half Black. He gets his Portuguese from his father, whereas the First Nations, Irish, and Black are from his mother.&nbsp;</p><p>There isn't much detail available on his parents. So, their names, profession, and whereabouts remain unknown. But, Kiana, in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>L'Officiel</i></a>, has talked about what it was like growing up with her parents, which gives us a bit of an idea of how Nikane's parents are. Upon asked why she chose to become an actor, she said:</p><p>I come from a family of storytellers; I’ve grown up in a household where we are constantly cracking jokes, sharing stories, and brainstorming ways to create. Being surrounded by humans who are not afraid to feel deeply and outwardly express those feelings had a huge influence on my desire to pursue a career as an actor. I have always admired truthful, bold expression of emotion and since I was a child I have been very curious to learn more about how and why we feel things as people.</p><p><i><strong>Check Out </strong></i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i><strong>MarriedCeleb</strong></i></a><i><strong> for more exciting Celebrity Bios</strong>.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqegpJmemnqurcOeoKuZ</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
