And it’s like, ‘Man, here I go again. There’s only one way to do it.’” He continued, “Whenever you may say, ‘Oh man, I want to make sure I spend a little more time doing this,’ your competitiveness takes over. And as much as you want to have this playful balance with the work balance, you’re going to end up doing exactly what you’ve always done. Which is why you are who you are. You’re going to go, ‘How do I get it done?’ You know, ‘What do I got to do to get it done?’”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-TB-Method-Tom-Brady.jpg alt='"The TB12 Method" by Tom Brady' style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-price data-transform data-truncate>$11.73+</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias=buy-now__original-price data-alignment data-theme=product-price-strikethrough data-transform data-truncate>$21.00</span><span class="_text_y7yck_1 _text_153t8_1" data-component=text data-alias data-alignment data-theme=product-percentage-off data-transform data-truncate>44% Off</span></p><p>For more about Tom Brady, read his book, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">The TB12 Method</a>.
