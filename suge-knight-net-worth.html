To the majority of people, Suge Knight is perhaps best known as a co-founder and the CEO of the record company called “Death Row Record”. Founded in 1991, the company reached international success with the release of <a href=#>Dr. Dre</a>’s debut studio album “The Chronic”, which managed to sell more than eight million CDs worldwide. Aside from securing numerous awards, <a href=#>Dre</a>’s album was also featured on a list of “500 Greatest Albums of All Time” and “1001 Albums You Must Hear before You Die”. Two years later, in 1993, <a href=#>Snoop Dogg</a> released his debut album called “Doggystyle” which, just as <a href=#>Dre</a>’s work, proved to be a major commercial success. Knight’s label received even more publicity in 1995, when <a href=#>Tupac Shakur</a> agreed to join “Death Row Records”. Over the years, the label has had such artists as Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes, <a href=#>MC Hammer</a>, “The Outlawz”, and <a href=#>Nate Dogg</a> among many others under their roof. However, the majority of artists decided to leave the label after the death of one of its most popular rappers, <a href=#>Tupac Shakur,</a> since the label started to lose its importance in the music industry.</p><h3>Suge Knight Net Worth $200,000</h3><p>A well-known executive producer and the founder of “Death Row Records”, how rich is Suge Knight? According to sources, in 2007 he earned as much as $4.56 million from the sale of his house in Malibu, while in 2009 he accumulated $5,000 after selling his jackets, and $2,500 for the sale of “Death Row Records” electric chair. In regards to his overall wealth, Suge Knight’s net worth is estimated to be $200,000, most of which he has gathered due to his involvement in the music industry.</p><p>Suge Knight was born in 1965, in California, United States, where he studied at the Lynwood High School. In high school, Knight participated in track and field contests, and played football. He continued his studies at El Camino College, and then attended the University of Nevada. While a student, Knight proved himself to be a skillful football player, which gained him an opportunity to take part in the NFL draft. He attended a training camp for the Los Angeles “Rams”, and was even given a chance to play two games with the team.</p><p>Since his professional football career proved to be unsuccessful, Knight decided to pursue a career in music instead, which gave rise to the “Death Row Records” label. It was with “Death Row Records” that Knight became a well-known face in the industry. With the success of signing such artists as <a href=#>Tupac Shakur</a>, <a href=#>Dr. Dre</a> and S<a href=#>noop Dogg</a> to the label, Suge Knight was enjoying a lot of public and media exposure. However, the tables turned when <a href=#>Tupac</a> was murdered in 1996, and Knight faced accusations of contributing to his death. Knight was placed in jail, while “Death Row Records” was sold to “Global Music Group” in 2008. As of April 2015, Suge has been charged with murder and attempted murder over a hit-and-run, following an altercation on the set of a commercial for the film “Straight Outta Compton”.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=14.518867924528><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$200 Thousand</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>April 19, 1965</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Compton, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>265 lbs (120.2 kg)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>American football player, Promoter, Bodyguard</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Michel'le (m. 1999–2002)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Children</td><td>Andrew Knight, Taj Knight, Bailei Knight, Posh Knight</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>Nicknames</td><td>Marion Knight Jr. , Marion "Suge" Knight, Jr. , Sugar Bear , Big Simon , Big Suge , Simon , Marion Hugh Knight , Suge</td></tr><tr readability=0.35555555555556><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/sugeknight662</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/sugeknight</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Record Labels</td><td>Death Row Records, 1017 Records</td></tr></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqysoJ1doLuqs8etZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
