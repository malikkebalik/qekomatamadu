The 13-year-old cheerleader's sister placed 114 stones into a jar to symbolize the number of times she was stabbed by 14-year-old attacker, <a href=# rel>Aiden Fucci.&nbsp;</a></p><p>Fucci, now 16, pleaded guilty in February to murdering 13-year-old Tristyn on Mother's Day in 2021. Baily said, "It was 1 hour and 42 minutes between when my sister was last seen and when Aiden Fucci was next seen running out of the woods, holding his shoes because his feet hurt...Aiden Fucci could show compassion for his sore feet, yet had nothing to leave for my beautiful sister," <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Daily Mail</a> reported.</p><p><strong>READ MORE&nbsp;</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>‘I’m sorry’: Aiden Fucci takes U-Turn, pleads guilty to fatally stabbing 13-year-old cheerleader Tristyn Bailey 114 times</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Aiden Fucci: Tristyn Bailey’s alleged killer bullies and threatens co-prisoners while awaiting trial</a></p><h2 class=split><strong>'Did you watch the life leave her eyes?'</strong></h2><p>Fucci will find out his fate on Friday. He faces at least 40 years in prison. Before deciding on his punishment, St Johns County Judge R Lee Smith is now considering comments from family members and others. While Bailey dropped the stones into the jar, her voiceover, as per the report, revealed the many questions she had for Fucci, including if he got "too caught up in the thrill of the kill."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/c0012e3b-45d3-4e9b-a1b5-4025f0fdaa0b.jpg><p>She questioned whether her sister saw him coming at her with the knife or whether he stabbed her while she wasn't paying attention. Bailey also wondered whether Tristyn screamed out for help or was paralyzed with agony and whether Fucci heard her lungs gargling with blood or saw it in her face when he realized she could no longer breathe due to her collapsed lungs. She also asked what Tristyn's last words were and whether Fucci stayed to watch her die or left her there in agonizing pain as he ran away. Bailey expressed how the memories of that day would forever be ingrained in her mind, body, and soul, and wondered whether she could have saved her sister. "How long did she suffer? Did you watch the life leave her eyes?" she asked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/c70ec252-5b67-46ab-b4f8-43fa72c79dcb.png><h2 class=split>'Took the very life that I brought into this world'</h2><p>Tristyn's mother Stacy said Fucci was "beyond saving" as the family asked the judge for the maximum sentence as Aiden Fucci made a "heinous decision on May 9, 2021, and took the very life that I brought into this world." "Tristyn was a 13-year-old. She had a personality brighter than fireworks, and she was being a teenager,” Tristyn’s brother, Teegan Bailey, said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/7e504fcc-f17a-4a5e-8f1b-5e193f0831fd.jpg><p>Fucci also wrote a letter to the judge, apologizing to the Bailey family, the community as well as his parents for the harm he had caused. He expressed that he missed his mother's lemon pepper chicken and told his father that he was "special because you made fun out of nothing." However, the apology did little to console the grieving family who asked the judge for the maximum sentence. At the end of each victim impact statement, the family placed a white stone in the jar representing the loss of belief in good people and safe school systems, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Click Orlando</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRomZyaxaq%2FjJuYoqSVrnq0uMCipWaslZq7bsDRoqqtsZ5ir6K1y56wrGWjnsC1sdFmp66so2K1pq3RrWSsoJGlsqV50q2mp52jYravwM5moZqqXZ67brLLqKminJFisLDB0a0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
