Smith was a goaltender when he was younger. He has also worked at IGA and Costco locations.</p><p>Smith grew interested in a professional wrestling career when one of his Transcona Collegiate Institute (TCI) buddies began training with Top Rope Championship Wrestling (TRCW) in Winnipeg. Smith abandoned his ice hockey dreams and began training with TRCW promoter Bobby Jay, whom he met while stacking shelves at an IGA. Smith, then 16, made his professional wrestling debut in 2000 after a year of training with Jay. He then wrestled for TRCW for two years, using the gimmick of a Hawaiian surfer named Kenny Omega.</p><p>The surfer part was eventually discarded in favor of an otaku-inspired gimmick. He graduated from TCI in 2001 and enrolled in university, but dropped out during his first year to pursue professional wrestling full-time.</p><h2>Kenny Omega net worth</h2><p>According to First Sportz, Kenny Omega’s estimated net worth in 2023 is calculated to be around $2 Million.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-637 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span>Kenny Omega salary</h2><p>Kenny Omega reportedly gets $3 million per year in AEW.
