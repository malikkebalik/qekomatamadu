I did use it tho. This is so inspiring to look back. The girl was leaking blood and spent days in the hospital. The word on the street was that I was gonna b deported. I was so scared. LOL. I was ‘on the run.’ I rlly thought I was in a ghetto movie. I hid my car and went to stay with my Aunt in Brooklyn chile.

Not only is she married and the mother of a baby boy, the 38-year-old is also one of the biggest female artists in music history.

But in a candid social media moment, Nicki admitted she didn’t feel like her bars stacked up next to Wayne and Drizzy’s.</p><p>“All I know is that they washed me on #SeeingGreen,” she tweeted on Saturday (May 15). “I’m a woman enough to admit when I’ve been washed on a track by the Greats. And it’s ok #Barbz I’ve washed them b4. We’ll live through this one. I was still a lil rusty. I washed them in my head on #Fractions.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Whatever the case, Nicki’s fans are simply thrilled she’s back in the mix and her “semi-retirement” is seemingly over.</p><p>Check out the updated version of Beam Me Up Scotty below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZmZ354g46toK2klWO7qq%2FKomSmoZ6Wt27A1p6cratdmbKtsdOeqmaglad6c3yPbGSmrZeotbDAjJ%2BpqKVdrLKivM6nqmaon6jApr%2FSoqanZZGnv6a%2F0w%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
