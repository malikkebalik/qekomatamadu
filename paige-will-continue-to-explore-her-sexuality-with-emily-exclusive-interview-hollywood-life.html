Now that viewers know Paige is just tortured, rather than crazy — I’ve already forgiven her for attempting to drown Emily in the pool — Lindsey hopes we’ll all be a little more sympathetic to her character."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

This is something that’s been festering, but she didn’t know [that kiss] was going to happen until it happened.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Speaking of the big kiss, Lindsey says it was just as “awkward” as you might expect.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“We decided not to do the kiss during rehearsal and save it for the first take,” she tells us. “I was so nervous that when I went in to kiss her, I totally got the side of her mouth. It was really awkward, and the camera was shooting us from the side, so you could totally see. I didn’t land it very well. It got better after that.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>But Lindsey adds that working alongside Shay made everything a lot easier:</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“Shay is literally the nicest person with the biggest heart. [When you join an successful show] you’re walking into someone else’s family. She welcomed me with open arms and made it so much fun.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Overall, Lindsey says she feels really fortunate to get to play a young gay character on TV at such an important time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“I really appreciate the opportunity I was given,” she says. “I understand that I’m representing a huge part of society, and I want that to be authentic, even though I have no first-hand experience.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/andy_sigandimage_pink2.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h3>Click here to talk Pretty Little Liars with Andy on Twitter</h3><p>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlhZH1ze5BxZqmqlanBunnLoqutpJViuaqt0axkrKifnrmmvoypmKKflWKyrrXLsmSdmaSeu6h5zJqwmmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
