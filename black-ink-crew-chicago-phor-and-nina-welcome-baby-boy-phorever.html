Congratulations to the duo! It's vital that these moments are cherished and that as long as the child's needs are put first, they can't go wrong on this one.</p><p>Having said that, it was pretty evident that Phor had some temperament issues as seen from the previous episode. He called out on Nina for packing her stuff to move out (unreasonable, no doubt, but she is allowed to be, especially now) over a minor tiff they had. The least he could have done at that very moment was to try and understand a heavily pregnant woman and her hormones talking, but he let his ego and attitude get in the way and let it get the better of himself. To make amends, Phor insists that Nina stay and that they'll give each other the space they need, which seemed civil.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/30e523db-e6ce-4a88-8caa-d934924d3c7f.jpg><p>In the recent episode, we see Phor with Nina every step of the way, as she goes into labor at the hospital. He is there to calm her down, nurse her head and hold her hand through the entire process. Phor also admitted that the couple may have their ups and downs but he has decided to throw old habits down the drain and be a better man for Nina and the best father to their child. He promises to be there for her as she needs him the most right now, and he is here to stay, for good. Phor's change in character and behavior is truly commendable.
