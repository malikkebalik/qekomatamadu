We hope our journey seen in the docuseries will encourage, motivate and inspire young people around the world. We look forward to this great adventure ahead with director Barbara Kopple.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Linda added in her own <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram post</a>, “To finally have the opportunity to tell our story in collaboration with the brilliant team at Imagine, and under the direction of Barbara Kopple, is as exciting for us as we hope it will be for viewers. I would love for people to see this as a celebration of not only our individual stories, but also to the power of friendship, dreams and perseverance.” Christy wrote on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> as well, “I am looking forward to looking back on this unprecedented time in fashion with these incredible women whom I have grown up with.”</p><h2>Who Will Star In The Super Models?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>The Super Models will spotlight the lives and careers of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Naomi Campbell</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cindy Crawford</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Linda Evangelista</strong></a>, and <strong>Christy Turlington</strong>, who are widely regarded as the “original” supermodels. All 4 women are featured in the first teaser. The docuseries will give “unprecedented access to the models” and take viewers “behind the camera and beyond the catwalk, revealing how they dominated the elite modeling world while illuminating a bond that single-handedly shifted the power dynamic of an entire industry,” according to Apple TV+.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-supermodels-docuseries-appletv-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Naomi, Cindy, Linda, and Christy were part of the “Big Six” in the 1990s, the coveted group of supermodels who graced the catwalks, beauty ads, and magazine covers everywhere. <strong>Kate Moss</strong> and<strong> Claudia Schiffer</strong> were also members of the “Big Six” in the 1990s. These supermodels became global phenomena.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>In the decades since the 1990s, these supermodels have continued to be household names. They’ve also had major developments in their personal life. Naomi recently <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed her second child</a>, a baby boy.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Cindy married <strong>Rande Gerber</strong> in 1998 and they have two children: <strong>Presley</strong> and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kaia Gerber</strong></a>. Kaia has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>followed in her mother’s footsteps in modeling</a> and has become one of the fashion world’s most in-demand models. Cindy also has her own beauty line, Meaningful Beauty, and furniture collection.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Linda gave birth to a son, <strong>Augustin</strong>, in 2006. Her son’s father is billionaire <strong>Francois-Henri Pinault</strong>, who is now married to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Salma Hayek</strong></a>. In recent years, Linda became incredibly reclusive and finally opened up about why she withdrew from public life in a 2021 Instagram post. She claimed that she had been <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“brutally disfigured”</a> after suffering a rare side effect from a cosmetic procedure she had in 2016.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“I loved being up on the catwalk. Now I dread running into someone I know,” she told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> in 2022. “I can’t live like this anymore, in hiding and shame. I just couldn’t live in this pain any longer. I’m willing to finally speak.” Linda has since opened up about her nightmare experience and has settled her CoolSculpting lawsuit. She <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>modeled for Fendi</a> in her first modeling job since the ordeal.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-supermodels-docuseries-appletv-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>Christy married actor <strong>Edward Burns</strong> in 2003. They have two children together: <strong>Grace</strong> and <strong>Finn</strong>. Christy made her directorial debut with the 2010 film No Woman, No Cry. She also launched the non-profit Every Mother Counts, an organization striking to make pregnancy and childbirth safe for mothers everywhere.</p><h2>What Will The Super Models Be About?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>The official synopsis for the docuseries reads: “The Super Models travels back to the 1980s, when four women from different corners of the world united in New York. Already forces in their own right, the gravitas they achieved by coming together transcended the industry itself. Their prestige was so extraordinary that it enabled the four to supersede the brands they showcased, making the names Naomi, Cindy, Linda, and Christy as prominent as the designers who styled them. Today, the four supermodels remain on the frontlines of culture through activism, philanthropy, and business prowess. As the fashion industry continues to redefine itself — and women’s roles within it — this is the ultimate story of power and how four women came together to claim it, paving the way for those to follow.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Naomi opened up about the upcoming docuseries in her 2022 <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue</a> cover story. “<span style=font-size:1.125rem>It’s about our life and times together: our friendship, careers, our womanhood, our motherhood,” she said. Naomi, Cindy, Christy, and Linda are all executive producers on The Super Models. “As models, we don’t have any rights to our image, so it feels good to be partners on our legacy – and in our own words,” Naomi added.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9OhnGarpaWys3nMqJuepKNisbCv1Kacp6yRp8ZugZBsaWprZWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
