“Everyone in the tabloids and media weren’t really leaving me alone about it,” 22-year-old Angelina told Father Albert about her former party life. “Basically I wanted it to be my personal business and it really wasn’t,” she continued. “It was really hard and I went through a lot of stress and I ended up losing the baby."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

So that was a big thing.”</p><p>I’m not Angelina Pivarnick’s biggest fan, but of course I wouldn’t wish this tragedy on anyone. I hope she’s OK and is able to find someone that gives a crap about her so she can try again in the future, perhaps after her 15 minutes are completely up.</p><p>That being said, I don’t understand why someone that appears so desperate to be a celebrity (She constantly attends events that will let her attend and even recorded a song) can blame her misfortune on the stress caused by being in the media spotlight – and a pretty dim spotlight at that.</p><p>Top photo: Rachel Worth/WENN.com<br>Proposal photo: WENN.com</p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3><span class="share-item twitterbtn"><a href=# class=twitter-share-button data-via=starcasm>Tweet</a></span> <span class="share-item gplusbtn"></span><span class="share-item facebookbtn"></span><span class="share-item pinbtn"><a href=# class=pin-it-button count-layout=horizontal>Pin It</a></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpJa%2FpK3SpmWnnaRkt6a%2B0p6wZquYpL%2Bmv4yapaCdnJ67onnPoq2aqp6esKx50Z6tnpmcqHqutdKcmKuqmZa0pnnOp2SfmaSdsrN5wKWZnqqkYsCpu9ZmmaWZnZrAbrnEnaCaZZKkxqe%2ByJ6lnWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
