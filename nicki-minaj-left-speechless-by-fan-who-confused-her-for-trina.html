On my way home, I asked the driver to drop me off at this store,” Minaj began. “I get in the store and I pick up a couple of things. I look exactly like this. I go up to the cash register and the man at the register, he start looking at me like, you know, he didn’t want to blow my cover, ’cause there’s other people waiting right behind me in the store.”</p><p>She continued: “So I lean in ’cause it’s clear that he’s trying to tell me something and I don’t want to talk too loud. He was so serious, but he was mad excited. So I’m like, ‘Of course, global icon superstar.’ I’m thinking in my head, ‘It’s okay.’ He leans in and with all seriousness he said, ‘I been listening to you all day.'”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>The cashier then told Nicki, “That old school shit is my favorite,” which left her confused as she’s not considered a part of that generation. The confusion became clear once the cashier said, “That one with you and <a class=underline-link href=#>Trick Daddy</a>,” referring to Trina’s collaborations with the veteran Miami rapper.</p><p>Nicki capped off the video by recreating the deadpan expression she gave the cashier before letting out a resounding “sir.”</p><a title=@nickiminaj href=# rel=noopener>@nickiminaj</a><a title="♬ original sound - Nicki Minaj" href=# rel=noopener>♬ original sound – Nicki Minaj</a><p>Nicki Minaj and Trina actually <a class=underline-link href=#>joined forces on a track titled “BAPS”</a> in 2019, which flipped the 2000 Cash Money classic&nbsp;“Project Bitch.”</p><p>Things went sour, though, when Trina’s A&R, Reginald Saunders, accused Nicki of not promoting the single.
