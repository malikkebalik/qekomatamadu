Previously, he played for the San Francisco Giants (2008-2016) and Los Angeles Dodgers (2017). During his career, he has won three World Series, all three with the Giants, in 2010, 2012, and 2014, while in 2013 he made it into the All-Star team.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Sergio Romo is, as of mid- 2017? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Romo’s net worth is as high as $6 million, an amount earned through his successful career as a baseball player which began in 2008, however, as Sergio’s annual salary now amounts to $3.5 million, an upward revision may occur sooner rather than later.</p><h3>Sergio Romo Net Worth $6 Million</h3><p>Sergio is the son of Mexican parents. His father and grandfather had been heavily involved in sports, and it wasn’t long before he followed the male side of the family. His father having built a pitching mound in the backyard of the Romo home, young Sergio started learning a thing or two from his father, and as hegrew up, his focus on baseball became deeper. He went to Brawley Union High School where he played mostly as a shortstop, but was also used on third base. He matriculated in 2001, but no scholarship offers came his way. Disappointed, Sergio started searching for a new challenge and was close to joining the army, however, he changed his mind and enrolled at Orange Coast College, but then transferred to Arizona Western College. He played extremely well at Arizona Western College, being named to the All-Region I second team of the Arizona Community College Athletic Conference in 2002 and 2003. He played baseball for several colleges, including the University of North Alabama in 2004, and Mesa State College in 2005, and was named as the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference Pitcher of the Year.</p><p>Although he was quite successful in college, these colleges belonged to minor leagues, and as a result, he was selected as the 852nd overall pick in the 2005 MLB Draft by the San Francisco Giants. He played three years in the minor leagues before joining the MLB squad of the Giants, and made his debut on the 26th June 2008 against the Cleveland Indians. During his rookie season, Sergio made 29 appearances in the majors, having a 3-1 record with a 2.12 ERA, and added 33 strikeouts with eight walks in 34 innings. Proving that he was worthy of the MLB and the Giants, he had positive results in the seasons to come, playing in around 70 games per year, also making over 70 strikeouts per season. This earned him a new contract with the Giants, which he signed in 2014 worth $15 million over two years, which only increased his wealth, but also helped his team to win three World Series during his stay.</p><p>After his contract with the Giants expired, Sergio signed a contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers worth $3 million for one year. Unfortunately, his numbers fell drastically and he played in only 30 games, after which he was removed from the roster. In July 2017 he was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays for cash considerations or a player, who would later be revealed.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Sergio is married to Chelsea, and the couple has two sons together.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=5.8912529550827><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Sergio Romo</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$6 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$3.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 4, 1983</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Brawley, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.8 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>84 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Baseball pitcher</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>University of North Alabama, Orange Coast College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Chelsea Romo</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Rilen Serge Romo, Rex Ryder Romo</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Leticia Romo, Frank Romo</td></tr><tr readability=0.35897435897436><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/sergioromo54</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4797842/</a></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=3><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Sunday Night Baseball</td><td>2010-2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself - San Francisco Giants Pitcher</td></tr><tr><td>WWE Raw</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>2012 World Series</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Mini-Series</td><td>Himself - San Francisco Giants Closing Pitcher</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/salary.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/4797842_Sergio-Romo/4797842_2012-World-Series-2012.png><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/movies.networthpost.org/movies/thumbs/4797842_Sergio-Romo/4797842_Sunday-Night-Baseball-20102013.png><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqycq5%2BZpHqzu8yoZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
