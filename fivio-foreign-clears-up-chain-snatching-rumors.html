In his opinion, it would be “impossible” for the average person to get close to the “Big Drip” rapper due to his security. “The guy [usually] has like six, seven security guys with him,” he said.</p><p>Loui then took it a step further and called “cap” at the rumored theft, noting that the chain “never left his neck.” A few minutes later, Fivio called to confirm what he had said. Almost immediately, Loui turned his phone around so everyone could see that Fivio was, in fact, rocking the chain in question.</p><p>Check out the clip below:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Fivio Foreign clears up chain-snatching rumors<a href=#>https://t.co/52WCdDsvQr</a><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rYt0fijrwk</a></p><p>— HipHopDX (@HipHopDX) <a href=#>June 7, 2023</a></p><p>Fivio Foreign had the chain made last year by GLD as part of a larger collection for the jewelry company.
