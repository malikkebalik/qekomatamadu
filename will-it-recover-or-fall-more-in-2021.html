With a strong focus on digital transformation, Bionovate plans to develop an FDA-approved platform of medical devices, mobile apps, and biosensors to turn tests that were earlier only performed in physical laboratories into tests that anyone with a mobile device can perform.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marketrealist.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">BIIO stock is rising.</h2><p>On May 3, BIIO stock surged significantly after the company said that it had filed an application to list its common stock on the Nasdaq Exchange. Nasdaq is the world’s second-largest exchange in terms of market capitalization and it's home to most of the best tech companies worldwide. BIIO stock is up 37 percent over the last month and 851 percent over the last year.</p><p>BIIO stock is down 49 percent YTD and 71 percent from its 52-week high. The significant drop is mainly due to a broader sell-off in penny and speculative growth stocks as investors rebalanced their portfolios.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">BIIO applied for a Nasdaq listing</h2><p>On May 3, BIIO applied for a Nasdaq listing in the U.S. Listing the company's stock is subject to approval depending on a number of conditions, including fulfillment of the NASDAQ Capital Market's minimum listing criteria. BIIO plans to meet all of the relevant listing criteria.</p><p>With the listing, Bionovate would enter an important phase in the rapidly expanding global medical device industry. The move to the Nasdaq will improve the visibility and credibility of the company’s shares in order to reach out to a new group of investors. The move from over-the-counter to Nasdaq will also improve liquidity in the stock.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">BIIO’s stock forecast for 2021</h2><p>BIIO is a penny stock and none of the Wall Street analysts have provided a forecast for the healthcare company.

In the three months ended December 2020, the company reported a net loss of $32,434 compared to $45,569 in the same period a year ago. Also, the company doesn’t generate any revenues. As of December 2020, BIIO had total liabilities of $451,973 and no cash flow.&nbsp;</p><p>These factors raise serious doubt about BIIO’s ability to continue operations. <a href=#>Penny stocks</a> are more volatile and risky investments compared to large-cap stocks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDRnpiloaOpe6S7zGinaJqZnrxuv9OomqRllqS%2Fpq%2FArKtmamBnfnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
