He is a comedian and the show is a hit. The movie made on it also did well.</strong></p><p>There are a lot of comments and statements that the four comedians make on the show. But they are meant to amuse and are not always true. They have also talked about their private lives and sexuality in a joking way. But these statements did not match with their practical day-to-day life. Read on to know about their personal lives.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Sal_Vulcano_his_relationship_status></span>Sal Vulcano: his relationship status<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Sal Vulcano</a> has an impressive figure and a great sense of humor. Hence, he has a lot of female fan following. He flirts around with many female fans. But he has never disclosed anything about his personal life. People keep speculating on it. He passes comments on the show that further deepens the mystery around his love life.</p><p>In one of the show episodes, Sal had said that he is gay. Viewers were shocked. On the same episode, his co-star, James Murray also said that he was gay. Later, Sal retracted his statement and said that he said it so that James comes out of the closet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Sv.jpg><p>He said:</p><p>“It feels great that my best friend James has come out of the closet. That’s the reason I brought him here today. You see, I am not gay, but I knew if I said I was gay, he’d admit that he was gay.”</p><p>But towards the end of the show, James also claimed that he too was not gay. And James had later married in 2019.</p><p>People also coupled Sal with a lady by the name of <a href=#>Francesca Muffaletto</a>. There were also rumors that Sal and Francesca are married. But all these rumors turned out to be false. Sal is blissfully single and also not into any romantic relationship.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Joe_Gatto></span>Joe Gatto<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Joe Gatto</a> is married. His wife is Bessy and they had wed in September 2013. In 2015, the couple had a child, daughter Milana. And two years later, their second child delivered. It was their son, Remington.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Svttvj.jpg><p>Unfortunately, in January 2022, came the announcement that the two have parted ways. Bessy is an actress who is vegan and a human rights activist. She requests people to adopt and not shop for pets in the market.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=James_Murray></span>James Murray<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>James Murray</a> also is not gay. He has a girlfriend called Melyssa Davies. They purchased a home in New Jersey and James had proposed to her outside this house in 2019. Describing that moment when he proposed to <a href=#>Melyssa</a>, James told People magazine:</p><p>“I set up a picnic and champagne and a Scrabble board. I took her there to sign ‘documents’ [about the house] — there were no documents to sign,”</p><p>“And thank God she said yes.”</p><p>Melyssa has graduated from a nursing school. They wed in 2020 on 25 September.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Svusw.jpg><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Brian_Quinn></span>Brian Quinn<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Brian Quinn</a> has also kept his personal life under wraps like Sal. Probably, he is not married, has no kids, is single and not in any relationship. But he did mention once on the show that his first girlfriend had been in prison and was the sister of one of the top Hollywood stars. However, he did not name them and people were left guessing. But fans believed that he was talking about the half-sister of Leah Remini, Elizabeth. But there is neither a confirmation nor a denial from Brian on it. Elizabeth had a jail term in 2005 for cocaine trafficking.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Short_bio_on_Sal_Vulcano></span>Short bio on Sal Vulcano<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sal Vulcano is an American comedian and a member of Impractical Jokers. <a href=#>More bio…</a></p><p>Share this</p><strong>Disclaimer Statement</strong>: Married Biography's editors wrote and updated all of this data based on their best knowledge and understanding. <a href=#>Married Biography</a> does not guarantee these opinions or ideas.
