Goulding building his sponge house was cute but reminded me he acts really young. But he said he was 21.
He may be physically 21, but he acts like he is about 15, emotionally and mature-wise."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But he said he was 21.</p><p>He may be physically 21, but he acts like he is about 15, emotionally and mature-wise. I think because he was raised by a bunch of Italian women who are known to baby the boys in the family. I imagine the Bensonhurst women fit that bill. They mean well.</p><p>I know because my Italian mom used to treat my brothers like that. When my sisters and I would complain about spoiling the boys, we were told the girls were more mature and could look after themselves with no problems.</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>Yes, he does act young. It’s really a shame because he is a cutie. I am hoping that it turns out that either Dante or Jason is his father. There is a reason he was brought to Port Charles. He told a couple people that his Dad was killed in action, but people say that when they want to cover up who the father is. Did they mention who his mother is? I missed that. It’s sad that he only knows his aunts, uncles, and cousins, no immediate family. I would think that Lois and Olivia must know something.</p><p>I heard Dante is leaving the show, so it’s probably not him. Jason already has 2 sons he is just getting to know, and Sonny has too many already, but he has provided for Gio most of his life. So maybe even Jagger?</p><p>Dante leaving? Hmmmm, that could open up a lot of story lines…</p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>LULIX</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>June 27, 2024, 6:19am <span itemprop=position>6</span></span><p>Dante leaving again?

They would be great friends. I don’t want him with Trina either. She needs a strong, OLDER acting man. Gio is a cutie, but just very young and immature for either Joss or Trina. IMO!</p><p>Thank you.
