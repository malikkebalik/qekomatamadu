Drizzy made the comments during a live stream with Stake over the weekend, where he hit out at his haters and critics while making threats at the camera.
“To the rest of you — the non-believers, the underachievers, the tweet and deleters — you guys make me sick to my stomach, fam,” he said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

That’s what I thought.”</p><p>Metro Boomin, who many fans assumed was Drake’s target, seemingly responded on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday (December 18) by posting the viral “Whoa Calm Down Jamal, Don’t Pull Out the 9” video.</p><p>The skit is about an argument between a group of Black people and racist white people (played by Black actors) on a basketball court. One of the “white” people says to one of the Black people: “Whoa calm down Jamal, don’t pull out the 9,” referring to a 9mm gun.</p><p>See his post below.</p><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/VOWNtlLald</a></p><p>— Metro Boomin (@MetroBoomin) <a href=#>December 19, 2023</a></p><p>Although Drake didn’t mention anyone in particular when making his “tweet and deleters” comment, <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Metro Boomin recently tweeted and deleted a post throwing shade at the Toronto native’s Her Loss album with 21 Savage</a>.</p><p>In response to a social media post about Metro’s <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Heroes & Villains</a> album accumulating more streams than <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Her Loss</a>, the producer wrote: “Yet Her Loss keeps winning rap album of the year over H&V. Proof that award shows are just politics and not for me.”</p><p>“Idc about awards honestly, the true award and REWARD is knowing that the music I spend so much time on brings joy to people’s everyday lives,” he added.</p><p>Drake seemingly fired back on his Instagram Stories not long after, quoting lyrics from <a href=# rel=noopener>JAY-Z</a>‘s “Heart of the City (Ain’t No Love)”: “Damn, little mans, I’m just tryin’ to do me/ If the record’s two mil, I’m just tryin’ to move three.”</p><p>He then appeared to cut ties even further by <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>unfollowing Metro Boomin on Instagram</a>.</p><p>It’s unclear what sparked the apparent rift between the “Knife Talk” collaborators, but <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Metro revealed earlier this year that he took Drake off his Heroes & Villains album.</a></p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/12/DX_Awards_2023_Best-Producer-Nom_Thumbnail-1-250x142.jpg alt="Best Rap & Hip Hop Producers of 2023" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> editorial</span></p>Best Rap & Hip Hop Producers of 2023<p class=related-article--meta-information>December 6, 2023</p></a><p>“Really, it was a song I had did with Travis and Thug, originally for my album,” Metro told <a href=# rel=noopener>DJ Drama</a> of the <a href=# rel=noopener>Travis Scott</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Young Thug</a>-assisted “Trance.” “I was in the studio with Drake one time because we were gonna do some stuff for my album. He just wanted to hear some songs from my album, and then he heard that one.</p><p>“He really wanted to get on it but I was letting him know that it was really just done for real. I was really just set on how it was. I was like, ‘Bro, I ain’t trying to sell you no dream. I’m locked in where it was.’ He had hit me and was just like, ‘Let me see if there’s anything you could add to it.’ He was like, ‘If you don’t like it, then whatever.’”</p><p>He continued: “He did some stuff, a couple parts was cool but like I just felt like just even with like Slime verse and Trav verse and the outro, it wasn’t just no room. It wasn’t nothing personal… I just ended up using the original and I guess the other one just leaked or something.”</p><p>A version of “Trance” featuring Drake’s verse leaked online months after the album’s release.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0miknqyipHqju86moKdllKeurLGMra6enaRisaa4xK2cq6tdp7K0vM6nqp4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
