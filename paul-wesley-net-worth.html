He has been accumulating his net worth by his popularity not only as an actor, starring in the TV series “The Vampire Diaries” playing Stefan Salvatore, but a model as well. He is also recognized as a film producer and director.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Paul Wesley is? According to sources, it is estimated that the size of his net worth is over $3 million, with his career in acting and modeling earning him a big part of his fortune since his career began in 1999.</p><h3>Paul Wesley Net Worth $3 Million</h3><p>Paul Wesley is the second child of Tomasz and Agnieszka Wasilewski, and&nbsp; spent his childhood traveling between Poland and the USA, so he speaks Polish and English. He attended both Marlboro High School and Christian Brothers Academy, and although he was very keen to be educated, he also spent free time in NYC theatre. He became very interested in developing an acting career, and so shifted to another school; in his junior year 1999, he debuted in the role of Max Nickerson in the TV series “Guiding Light” (1999-2001) and his net worth started rising. After matriculation, he became a student at Rutgers University, but only for one semester, because his acting career reached the professional level, so much so that after his first five years in the business, he decided to change his surname from Wasilewski to Wesley, because of the pronunciation.</p><p>In 2001, he appeared in the TV series “Wolf Lake” in the role of Luke Cates, and from that point on, his name became more and more noteworthy in the acting profession, and he appeared in more recognizable roles, such as Tommy Callahan in the TV series “Everwood” (2003-2004), and in “American Dreams” (2002-2005) as Tommy DeFelice. Furthermore, he guest-starred in “Law & Order: Criminal Intent” (2002), “Smallville” (2003), “CSI: Miami” (2004), and CSI: NY” (2005), which all helped increase his net worth.</p><p>In 2004, he made his big screen debut in the film “The Lust Run”, which was soon followed by a bigger role in the film “Roll Bounce” (2005). Wesley soon climbed up the ladder, and in 2006 he was cast as Trevor in the film adaption of the novel “Way of The Peaceful Warrior” – changed to “Peaceful Warrior” (2006) – directed by Victor Salva.</p><p>Wesley’s net worth started to increase dramatically when he was chosen for a lead role alongside <a href=#>Ian Somerhalder</a> and <a href=#>Nina Dobrev</a> in the American supernatural TV drama series “The Vampire Diaries” (2009-2016) on The CW, based on the book of the same name by L. J. Smith. The same year he also featured as one of the leading cast members of the highly popular TV series “24”. To speak further of his successful career, Paul has shown his talents in films such as “Killer Movie” (2008), “Elsewhere” (2009), “Before I Disappear” (2014), and “Baytown Outlaws” (2012), among others, which have all added to his net worth.</p><p>His latest ventures in the entertainment industry include appearances in the films “Mother’s Day”, “Convergence”, and “Late Bloomer”, all 2016 releases.</p><p>For his accomplishments in the entertainment industry, he has won a number of awards, such as several Teen Choice Awards for his role in “The Vampire Diaries”.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Paul Wesley was married to <a href=#>Torrey DeVitto</a> from 2011 until 2013. He has been in a relationship with Phoebe Tonkin since 2013. Currently, he lives in Marlboro, New Jersey. In his free time, he enjoys snowboarding and playing hockey. Wesley is a supporter of several charities, such as The Humane Society of the United States.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=27.259815242494><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Paul Wesley</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 23, 1982</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 10 in (1.8 m)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Model, Film director, Film Producer</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Education</td><td>Monmouth Academy, Marlboro High School, Christian Brothers Academy, Rutgers University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Torrey DeVitto (m. 2011–2013)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Agnieszka Wasilewski, Thomas Wasilewski</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Siblings</td><td>Julia Wasilewski, Leah Wasilewski, Monica Wasilewski</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nicknames</td><td>Paul Wasilewski , Paul Thomas Wasilewski</td></tr><tr readability=0.32><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/paulwesleyofficial</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/paulwesley</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/paulvedere</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0913587</a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Awards</td><td>Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actor/Choice TV/Cast To Watch, Young Hollywood Award for Best Threesome (2014)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Nominations</td><td>People's Choice Award for Favorite Dramatic TV Actor, Bravo Otto - Superhottie (2013)</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Movies</td><td>“Killer Movie” (2008), “Elsewhere” (2009), “Before I Disappear” (2014), “Baytown Outlaws” (2012), “Mother’s Day”, “Convergence”, “Late Bloomer” (2016)</td></tr><tr readability=11><td>TV Shows</td><td>“Guiding Light” (1999-2001), “Wolf Lake”, “Everwood” (2003-2004), “American Dreams” (2002-2005), “Law & Order: Criminal Intent” (2002), “Smallville” (2003), “CSI: Miami” (2004), CSI: NY” (2005)</td></tr></table><table class=trademarks><tr><th>#</th><th>Trademark</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Thick eyebrows</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Spiked dark hair</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=7.5><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>'Catcher in the Rye' changed my life when I was a kid.
