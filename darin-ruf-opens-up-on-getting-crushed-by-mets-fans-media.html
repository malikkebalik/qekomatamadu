The 36-year-old was brought to Flushing at last year’s trade deadline to provide right-handed pop as a platoon player, but never hit a home run across 77 plate appearances (including playoffs) before the Mets gave up on him at the end of spring training last month.

So you’re kind of getting crushed by two entities. Even if you’re not on social media a heck of a lot, you still have an idea and you see things.”</p><p>Ruf has good career numbers against left-handers, having hit .272 with an .891 OPS, 39 home runs, and 102 RBIs in 706 career plate appearances against lefties.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/081222Mets079CW.jpg><p>Over his last 22 regular-season games, Ruf was 4-for-48 against all pitchers with 16 strikeouts.</p><p>He started at DH in Game 2 of the Mets’ wild-card series against the Padres on Oct. 8, going 0-for-1 with a walk and a strikeout, and he was removed for a pinch-runner in the sixth after being hit by a pitch.</p><p>Ruf played most of last season with a heavy heart as his father, Bill, died in late May.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Want to catch a game?

When a lot of things get thrown your way at once, it’s hard to perform every single night on a stage like New York or really anywhere in Major League Baseball.</p><p>“Baseball is a very tough game and you have to be in a very good spot mentally to have success. I’m hoping I can get back to that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/04/20220914_MetsCubs028CS.jpg><p>Ruf hopes to regain the form he had with the Giants in 2021, when he slashed .283/.414/.593 against left-handers.</p><p>“I am very happy to be back,” Ruf said. “Last year … it didn’t go the way I personally wanted it to. Obviously not for the Giants as a team, either. And getting traded didn’t work out the way anyone wanted.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j21mamlfma6ztc1mqa6eXaS9prrSZqypZZ%2Bjeqix062gp59dmL%2B2v8eem2aaqWK6psDSZp2apqNiuqawyJpm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
