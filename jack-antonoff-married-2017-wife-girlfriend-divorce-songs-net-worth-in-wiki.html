She can do it in some places but not all places.</p><p>So are they seriously waiting for all the states to legalize gay marriage before they get married?

We both give ourselves over to the work that we’re making, and that’s a very intense experience. It’s a lot for anybody to live around, let alone two people to live around</p><p>Lena Dunham is perfect to be a Jack Antonoff’s wife. She is too loyal to his boyfriend or life partner. They have amazing chemistry in their relationships. Dunham said to&nbsp;SiriusXM radio:</p><p>I feel the more I’m alone, the more I turn into this rageful, hardened-shell of a woman…I never get the feeling of like, ‘Oh I wanna go out and’—I can curse on this show?—I’m never like, ‘I wanna go out and f–k little boys…I wanna stay in and re-read&nbsp;Madame Bovary&nbsp;and never speak to anyone again. My boyfriend is definitely the person who prevents me from doing that</p><p>Lena is more of Jack Antonoff’s wife than Jack Antonoff’s girlfriend.
