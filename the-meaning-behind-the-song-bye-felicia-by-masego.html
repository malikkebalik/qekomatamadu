Produced by D’Mile, this song samples 112’s “Anywhere,” adding a nostalgic touch to Masego’s unique style.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, the lyrics of “Bye Felicia” reveal a story of a former love and the satisfaction of moving on. Masego tells his ex that she will surely miss him with the now-trendy phrase, “Bye Felicia.” The term “Bye Felicia” gained popularity in recent years as a dismissive phrase used to bid farewell to someone who is irrelevant or unimportant. By incorporating this phrase into the song, Masego asserts his self-worth and shows that he has no time for negativity or toxic relationships.</p><p>Interestingly, the phrase “Bye Felicia” originally comes from the 1995 film “Friday,” where the character Felicia is dismissed with this farewell. Masego cleverly adopts this phrase to express his indifference towards his former love, adding a touch of humor and pop culture reference to the song.</p><p>Additionally, Masego highlights how he is irreplaceable, emphasizing how nobody else can compare to the love he provided. He acknowledges the attention his ex receives from others, but confidently states that no one else can fit her body like he did. This line speaks to the unique connection and intimacy he once shared with his love interest.</p><p>The catchy and memorable chorus, with its smooth rhythm and melodic vocals, adds to the overall appeal of the song. It intensifies the emotions conveyed by the lyrics and serves as an anthem for those who have moved on from toxic relationships or people who do not appreciate their worth.</p><p>As someone who has experienced heartbreak and the process of moving on, “Bye Felicia” serves as a reminder of the power and resilience when letting go of toxic connections. It encourages listeners to prioritize their happiness and self-worth above all else.</p><p>Overall, “Bye Felicia” by Masego is not just a catchy and enjoyable song; it carries with it a meaningful message of self-love and empowerment. It reminds us to say goodbye to toxic situations and people who do not value us. So, the next time you find yourself in need of a little boost of confidence, put on “Bye Felicia” and let Masego’s smooth voice and empowering lyrics guide you towards a healthier and happier mindset.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Album_Information></span>Album Information:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Title: Studying Abroad: Extended Stay (2021)</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Credits></span>Credits:<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Produced By: D’Mile</p><p>Written By: D’Mile & Masego</p><p>Assistant Mixing Engineer: Robert Mendioro & Daniel Vargas</p><p>Mastering Engineer: Mike Bozzi</p><p>Mixing Engineer: L10MixedIt</p><p>Release Date: November 13, 2020</p><p>Samples: “Anywhere” by 112 (Ft.
