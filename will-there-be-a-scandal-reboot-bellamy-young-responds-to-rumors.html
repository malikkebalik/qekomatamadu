I think everybody would be down,” she said.</p><p>As for what the series could be about, Soaps asked what she would name the Scandal reboot if the show was centered around Mellie. “I didn’t know it was going to be based on Mellie though, so I need to think for a second,” she said. When asked what she thought about the title Mellificent, Young laughed and said,&nbsp;“I think it’s been done, but let’s do it again. I’m not good with [coming up with names]. So let’s go with Mellificent.”</p><p>Scandal was ABC’s drama series following Olivia Pope, a self-proclaimed fixer, who ran the crisis management firm, Olivia Pope & Associates. The series revolved around Olivia’s team as they fix PR scandals around the political scene in Washington D.C. — including Olivia’s secret affair with the President of the United States, Fitzgerald Grant III, who is married to Young’s character, Mellie, the First Lady.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Bellamy-Young-Scandal-2.jpg alt="Bellamy Young - Scandal" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Scandal, which was created by Shonda Rhimes, premiered in 2012 and ran for sevn seasons until its series finale in 2018. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Extra</a> in December 2023, Washington also confirmed she would be down for a Scandal reboot movie. “That is a question for Shonda Rhimes. I will be there if it happens,” she said.</p><p>It could be a reality. Rhimes told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">IMdb</a> in May 2024 about which of her characters she would love to bring back. “Oh, Olivia Pope,” she said. “I like that character so much, even when she was bad.
