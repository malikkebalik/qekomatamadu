The past two weeks, I’ve been scratching my head at Bold & Beautiful‘s decision to make Sheila Carter their romantic lead. But this week, as she joyously accepted Deacon’s proposal and Finn officially became a full-blown Sheila shipper, I got it. I think. If I’m right, what’s coming will be awesome. If I’m wrong… well, there’s a first time for everything, right?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

If I’m wrong… well, there’s a first time for everything, right?&nbsp;</p><h2>A Soap Lover’s Lament</h2><p>Let’s get one thing out of the way right up front: I’ve been a fan of both Sheila and her portrayer Kimberlin Brown since first both appeared on&nbsp;The Young and the Restless way back in 1990. (Fun fact: Sheila joined that show only three years before&nbsp;Bold & Beautiful&nbsp;aired its first episode… that’s how long the character has been around!)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Kimberlin-Brown-Tracey-Bregman-Sheila-Lauren-rivalry-YR-CBS.jpg alt="Kimberlin Brown, Tracey Bregman, Sheila, Lauren rivalry Young and Restless" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>But I’m also a big believer in villains having a shelf life. It’s one of the reasons that&nbsp;The Edge of Night was my all-time favorite soap. That much-missed show knew that the key to a great villain was to cast an amazing actor, unleash them on your core characters and then give the audience of seeing them punished, whether by sending them off to jail or killing them.</p><p><strong>More: </strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Why it’s time to reboot The Edge of Night</a></p><p>No, not “kill” them in a manner that would allow them to return, but actually put them in a grave, preferably kicking off an epic murder mystery.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/news/2017/10/edge-of-night-cbs.png alt="Forrest Compton dead at 94 edge of night" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Edge&nbsp;understood that viewers need to see bad guys brought down. And that’s certainly truer in today’s world than it was during that soap’s run.</p><h2>Can We Believe Sheila’s Story?</h2><p>All of which brings me back to Sheila. Of course. Given that the entire show now revolves around her, that’s pretty much all we’re going to be talking about this week.</p><p>A lot of fans — especially those who are Finn/Steffy shippers — hate that he has suddenly decided to say, “Sure, she shot me and my wife, tried to kill my non-birth mom and has broken more laws than I have abs, but damnit, I love my psycho birth mom!”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Sheila-Finn-BB-HW_361bb4.jpg alt="Finn Sheila Deacon Hope B&B" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>In fact, he literally uttered this line to Hope: “What she did… it was heroic!” But was it really enough to completely whitewash Sheila’s history? Also — and this is no small point — how do we even know she’s telling the truth about having offered up her own life in exchange for those of Finn’s loved ones? All we have is Sheila’s word, and she is — at best — the very definition of an unreliable narrator.</p><h2>The Ultimate Plot Twist?</h2><p>But as usual, I’ve gotten waylaid. Remember way back at the start of this column I hinted at an awesome twist which will make all of this Sheila worshipping worth while? Well, what could be more rewarding for those who’ve waited years — literally decades — to see Sheila pay for her crimes than allowing her to get everything she ever wanted… and then rip the rug out from under her.</p><p>Think about it. Right now, Sheila is flying high. She’s got son Finn singing her praises, Deacon’s ring on her finger and even Hope seems ready to convince folks to give the nine-toed monster a chance. Sure, Steffy’s not likely to be as forgiving as Finn, but if that causes problems in his marriage, Sheila’s likely to see that as a win, too.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bb-sheila-eric-cbs-ec.jpg alt="sheila eric THE BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL, from left: Kimberlin Brown, John McCook, 1990s, 1987– . /© CBS / Courtesy Everett Collection" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Longtime viewers have seen this story play out before. Remember when Sheila was in love with Eric and believed that all of her dreams were going to come true? Heck, when <a href=# rel=noopener>I spoke with Brown</a> a while back, she admitted that “the story I’ve always tried to tell is that everything she does, she does for love. She’s never been given that love or even the chance, because whenever she’s gotten close, someone has gotten in the way, and that’s when she does the things that she does.”</p><p>Which brings us to what’s happening on screen right now. Sheila’s happier than she’s been in years — and so secure in her position that she’s literally taunting Li in the cruelest way possible — leaving me to wonder who’s going to be the person to take it all away and bring the self-sabotaging, impulsive, deadly side of Sheila roaring back.</p><p>Personally, that’s the moment I’m waiting for.</p><h2>Random Thoughts</h2><p>• I’ve literally lost track of how many weeks I’ve asked this question, but it will continue until we know the answer: What’s Paris up to these days?</p><p>• When Deacon told Finn, “It’s not enough to believe her, you have to believe&nbsp;in&nbsp;her!” I had visions of Peter Pan urging everyone to bring Tinkerbell back to life by clapping for her.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Tinkerbell-walt-disney-everett.jpg alt="RETURN TO NEVER LAND, The Lost Boys, Tinkerbell, Peter Pan, 2002 (c) Walt Disney.

Not to be outdone, Steffy later said that Hope “does have a soft spot for Deacon, her father.”</p><p>• I’m sorry, but it’s hard to take Finn seriously when he says crap like, “It never made sense that you went after Steffy.” Weirdly, that line could have been saved had they simply expanded it a bit. “Yes, there was a time when you were filled with hatred and anger toward her, but that night? There was no reason for you to attack her!”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Deacon-Hope-BB-HW.jpg alt="Deacon Hope B&B" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>• Hope fainting at the sight of Sheila may have been the most realistic reaction any soap character has ever had to another’s return from the dead.</p><p>• I love comedic moments on soaps, but that thing with Charlie interrupting Ridge, Carter and Steffy about a parking dispute just felt weirdly out of place.</p><p><strong>What better way to celebrate Mother’s Day than by taking a look at <a href=# rel=noopener>daytime’s best — and worst — moms</a>, which we do below!&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmraCVYq%2BwuMNmmKecXam1pnnBnpiurJmbwq170qiYqZqfrXx4fphyamlnp52yr3nWoqOlZaOdsqq4wGanmrFdl7JuvNSnoKyglZl8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
