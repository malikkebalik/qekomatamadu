Even when you‚Äôve come off the bench in the 83rd minute to score an incredible match-winning free kick, you still have to take part in Burnley‚Äôs post-match substitute warm-down.
Scott Twine will not have cared.
The massive smile still plastered across his face beamed brightly as he completed shuttle runs across the Turf Moor pitch following Burnley‚Äôs 2-1 victory over West Bromwich Albion last night."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

As he entered the dressing room, his team-mates surrounded him and began the chant again.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Scotty Twine Twine Twine <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/csmPVFM4H3</a></p><p>‚Äî Burnley FC (@BurnleyOfficial) <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">January 20, 2023</a></p><p>This moment had been a long time coming and nobody could hide their delight for a player who has had such a difficult six months.</p><p>Since arriving from MK Dons of League One as the first signing of Burnley‚Äôs post-relegation rebuild in late June, anticipation and excitement quickly grew, but things have not gone to plan.</p><p>After a substitute appearance on the opening weekend of the Championship season against <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Huddersfield</a>, where he hit the post from a free kick, Twine was not in another matchday squad before the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>World Cup</a> break as he struggled with niggling injury problems.</p><p>But as soon as referee Jarred Gillett blew his whistle to award Burnley a free kick just outside the area in the last few minutes of Friday‚Äôs match, all eyes were on the now fully-fit Twine.</p><p>These situations are his bread and butter. His unique set-piece ability has been <a href=#>honed to perfection since he was a young boy</a> through extra work, repetition and practice every off-season and after training sessions, helping him score 20 league goals last season in the third tier as MK Dons made the play-offs.</p><p>The routine, the concentration; he was in the zone. The 23-year-old felt confident as soon as the free kick was awarded. So did his manager Vincent Kompany, who sees free kicks from such positions as if they are practically penalties when Twine is in the side.</p><p>As the ball curled into the net, with goalkeeper <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Alex Palmer</a> rooted to the spot, Twine turned away and sprinted off towards the corner flag in celebration.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>This was special; an outpouring of built-up emotion. He has been a goalscorer all of his life but he has been deprived of that so far this season.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>SCOTT TWINE THAT IS SENSATIONAL! ü§Øüî• <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/IFIeknl1jY</a></p><p>‚Äî Sky Sports Football (@SkyFootball) <a href=#>January 20, 2023</a></p><p>In one moment, all of that work to get back to full fitness, battling through the dark days and then waiting for his opportunity suddenly was worth it.</p><p>As well as needing time to adjust to the demands of Championship football, extra individual training sessions, including joining in with under-21 sessions during the World Cup break, were part of his progress back to full fitness.</p><p>He was ready when club football resumed last month but missing such a large chunk of a season in which his new club have performed so well without him has made breaking into the side far tougher.</p><p>Twine has featured in every matchday squad since Burnley‚Äôs season resumed on December 11 but after coming off the bench in the first three games, had been an unused substitute in the next five. There were even suggestions of a loan move with game-time scarce, but Kompany rubbished those rumours immediately.</p><p>With the scores level at 1-1 with seven minutes of normal time left last night, the manager turned to Twine to be his difference maker ‚Äî a key reason why he brought him to the club last summer.</p><p>Twine strode onto the pitch with purpose and a point to prove. He pressed effectively out of possession and found pockets of space with his clever movement.</p><p>The goal, four minutes after his introduction, took his confidence to another level.</p><p>Suddenly he looked the part, and no doubt felt the part, possibly for the first time in a Burnley shirt after spending so much time on the fringes of the team or on the outside looking in. His touch was excellent and he exchanged neat passes in tight areas as the Championship leaders ran out the clock on an eighth straight league win and 12th in 13 outings.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The squad have shared his pain, having watched him suffer and seen first-hand the frustration and disappointment he has carried. That was clear from the immediate celebration, including <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Anass Zaroury</a> with his arm around Twine, encouraging the crowd to cheer for his team-mate.</p><p>At full-time, <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Taylor Harwood-Bellis</a>, despite still having his protective boot on, hobbled over with impressive speed and was one of the first to emphatically embrace him. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Jack Cork</a> was close behind and his hug was just as passionate.</p><p>One by one, the other Burnley players congratulated him, each smiling widely. One of the last to grab hold of him was Kompany, who embraced Twine before grabbing his face and uttering a few words.</p><p>This was Twine‚Äôs moment, one he deserves after overcoming so much adversity.</p><p>The feel-good mood and excitement surrounding Turf Moor are continuing, with centre-back Hjalmar Ekdal set to become the club‚Äôs second signing of the January window. The 24-year-old Sweden international, who will join from Djurgardens of the Swedish top flight, flew to England earlier this week to undergo a medical and was at Turf Moor to watch this match.</p><p>Focus continues to centre around signing a new striker, and Burnley are in talks to sign Lyle Foster from Belgian side Westerlo.</p><p>Kompany was pictured alongside assistant Craig Bellamy over in Belgium watching the 22-year-old South African play against Genk earlier this week.</p><p>Indications from sources, who wished to remain anonymous to protect their position, in recent days were that Burnley felt they were closing in on a deal but reports in Belgium suggest the two clubs still differ in their valuations of the player.</p><p>For a side in such a position of strength this season already, Burnley continue to build positively for the short term and the more distant future.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Twine is set to be a big part of both and, as he continues to earn minutes, more moments of quality will surely follow.</p><p>(Photo: Martin Rickett/PA Images via Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k2poa2lnbnxzfJFsZmlpX2d%2BcL%2FCqKutZaSstq%2BxjJusq6acmsZuw8Ssq2aaoqS6cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
