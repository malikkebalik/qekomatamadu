Here are all the details of the “Pioneer Woman’s” family and their relationship with Jamar.</p><p class=Fg>Ree met her husband, Ladd Drummond, more than 23 years ago in a bar in Oklahoma. Having moved from Los Angeles, her expectations for a serious relationship were meager. They enjoyed the evening together and exchanged numbers, but Ladd didn’t call for four months.</p><p class=Fg>He made up for this absence by calling Ree and taking her out for dinner. Even though their lives did not seem compatible at first, Ladd had fallen in love within two weeks of dating. Ree even stopped being a vegetarian for her cattle rancher husband.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/f8da3e46d4332571be40e336357d502b.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Ree Drummond and her foster son, 18-year-old Jamar and one of his football games | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>HOW THE DRUMMOND FAMILY CAME ABOUT</strong></p><p class=Fg>The couple got married on September 21, 1996, and has five children. Alex was born in 1996 and Paige in 1999. Almost three years later, in 2002, Ree and Ladd's first son Bryce arrived. They gave him a brother when their youngest, Todd, was born in 2004.</p><p class=Fg>In 2020, Ree <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/food/ree-drummond-opens-up-about-the-natural-turf-wars-at-home-after-fostering-son-jamar>revealed</a> details of their fifth child, their foster child, Jamar. Ree <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/food/ree-drummond-opens-up-about-the-natural-turf-wars-at-home-after-fostering-son-jamar>said </a>she waited a year and a half after he moved in to speak about him because he deserved to have his privacy while settling into the family.</p><p class=Fg>Furthermore, state restrictions no longer applied to him as he had just turned 18 years old, and he no longer wanted to hide from the world.

Two days after moving into the home, Jamar suffered tendon damage to his foot while riding the Drummond family ATVs.</p><p class=Fg>While in hospital, Ree <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/food/ree-drummond-opens-up-about-the-natural-turf-wars-at-home-after-fostering-son-jamar>felt</a> so bad about Jamar’s accident that she overcompensated by overfeeding him. This led to him gaining 30 pounds he quickly lost as soon as he recovered. Jamar has since fully recovered, and the accident brought the family closer.</p><p class=Fg>Disagreements eventually occur even within the closest families, and the Drummond family is no different. Ree <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/food/ree-drummond-opens-up-about-the-natural-turf-wars-at-home-after-fostering-son-jamar>explains</a> that the boys have gotten into some heated arguments.“There’ve been some natural turf wars and personality clashes that Ladd and I have had to referee. It can be tricky,” she said. Ree <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/food/ree-drummond-opens-up-about-the-natural-turf-wars-at-home-after-fostering-son-jamar>added</a>:</p><p class=Fg>“[The] Drummond house is just one big soup of testosterone and disgusting gym bags, and sometimes Ladd and I just have to throw up our hands and surrender to the chaos and disruption.”</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>THE PARENTS EMBRACE THE CHAOS OF RAISING CHILDREN</strong></p><p class=Fg>Ree has embraced the chaos of parenthood. Here’s a rundown of all the Drummond family children with five children. Alex Drummond is the oldest child, she was born in 1997, and in 2018, she graduated from Texas A&M University. She also works with her mom on her Pioneer Woman brand.</p><p class=Fg>Paige Drummond was born in 1999 and is currently a student at the University of Arkansas. Her younger brother, Bryce, was born in 2002. He now <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/ree-drummond-kids-meet-the-pioneer-womans-4-children/>attends</a> the University of North Texas and is “recruited to play quarterback” for their football team.</p><p class=Fg>Todd Drummond is the youngest biological Drummond child. While in high school, he joined the family and is an avid football player. “This summer, Bryce and Jamar started fishing together, which always helps bring young men together,” Ree<a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/ree-drummond-kids-meet-the-pioneer-womans-4-children/> said</a>.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>REE'S LIFE RIGHT NOW</strong></p><p class=Fg>Ree continues to produce her cooking show, “The Pioneer Woman,” while being a hands-on mother. She also writes cookbooks and recently lost 60 pounds while preparing for her daughter Alex’s wedding. She has also produced several home cooking lines, including pots and measuring cups.</p><p class=Fg>In the months leading up to the wedding, a crash on the Drummond family ranch left her husband, Ladd, with a neck brace on and her nephew, Caleb, in critical condition. This accident propelled her to take control of her health and become fitter.</p><p class=Fg>She <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/pioneer-woman-ree-drummond-on-first-acting-role-and-how-family-inspired-her-50-pound-weight-loss>added</a>: "I have a cooking show, I write cookbooks, I have a cooking website. I have a restaurant, a bakery. So you know, it just kept creeping up, and in January of this year, we took my son, Bryce, to college. And I tell this story, but I hit rock bottom eating chips and salsa one night.”</p><p class=Fg>Ree <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/pioneer-woman-ree-drummond-on-first-acting-role-and-how-family-inspired-her-50-pound-weight-loss>said</a> that the weight loss has helped her feel great and improved her outlook on life. She<a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/pioneer-woman-ree-drummond-on-first-acting-role-and-how-family-inspired-her-50-pound-weight-loss> said</a> that even during the years she was thinner, she was not much of a squatter or lunger since she last took part in the ballet. But her current fitness journey has changed all that.</p><p class=Fg>She <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/pioneer-woman-ree-drummond-on-first-acting-role-and-how-family-inspired-her-50-pound-weight-loss>added </a>that exercise has helped her engage muscles she thought were long gone. Getting fitter has also helped her prepare for her first acting role on the "Food Network" and "Discovery+'s" original movie, Candy Coated Christmas. She <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/pioneer-woman-ree-drummond-on-first-acting-role-and-how-family-inspired-her-50-pound-weight-loss>said</a>:</p><p class=Fg>"It's definitely my first movie. I am not an actor, I am the host of a cooking show, but when Food Network asked if I wanted to participate in their first Christmas movie, I think I said yes in like point two seconds,"</p><p class=Fg>Ree’s children have been supportive of their mom as she prepares for this role. She <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/pioneer-woman-ree-drummond-on-first-acting-role-and-how-family-inspired-her-50-pound-weight-loss>said</a>, "my youngest said, 'Go, Momma,' and Jamar was encouraging, and then Bryce, my 18-year-old said, "Don't say anything cheesy, please." In the meantime, she films “The Pioneer Woman” a kitchen on the farm she calls “the lodge.”</p><p class=Fg>The lodge is not only where the show is filmed, but it's also where she does all kinds of food-related work. From testing new recipes to writing and photographing food for her cookbooks. She throws parties there too and opens it to tours on some weekdays.</p><p class=Fg>Ree <a class="Xd a" href=#>added</a> that her husband’s idea was to open the lodge to the public. The family farm also has The Mercantile, a shop that sells the show's exclusive merchandise, helpful kitchen tools, and apparel. The Mercantile's café offers light bites and sweet treats to all visitors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtvb3BgZXqzscRmm6utnaK8r7CMoaysmpGjsW60wJ1kq52Wmr%2BmsYytn56homKvb7TTpqM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
