In a large heavy pot or Dutch oven, toast chiles over medium-high, stirring occasionally until very fragrant, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer toasted ancho chiles to a food processor or spice mill and process until very finely ground. Set aside.</li><li>Add oil to pot and heat over medium-high. Add ground beef and cook, stirring occasionally to break beef into small pieces, until well-browned (about six minutes). Using a slotted spoon, transfer beef to a plate and set aside.</li><li>Add onion to pot and cook briefly over medium-high until barely softened, about two minutes. The secret is to undercook the onions.</li><li>Using a garlic press, press garlic directly into the pot, one clove at a time. Then stir in jalapeños, oregano, cumin, cayenne pepper and tomato paste. Stir and cook until fragrant, about two minutes. Add beer and continue to cook, stirring and scraping the pan, about seven minutes.</li><li>Meanwhile, put beans in a large bowl and mash briefly with a potato masher until broken up but not fully mashed.</li><li>Add mashed beans, stock, tomatoes, salt and cooked beef to pot. Cover and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low to maintain simmer and cook two hours so everything gets to know each other in the pot. Remove from heat, uncover and let stand at least one hour (can also be refrigerated eight hours or overnight).</li><li>Reheat gently, taste and add more salt if necessary, and serve with your favorite toppings. We recommend chopped scallions, shredded Jack cheese and sour cream.</li><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Brian Baumgartner as Kevin Malone in Episode 919, “Stairmageddon.” <span class=credit>NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via</span></figure><p>This isn’t the first time Peacock has hidden cooking instructions in their terms of use policy.
