She was very shy as a child and to overcome this, her parents used to send her for&nbsp;weekly elocution lessons.</li><li>This practice had eventually led to her getting selected for minor roles at nearby Universal Studios. For a significant part of her early childhood, her parents had placed her and her older sister in a children’s home. The sisters used to hate the environment there due to which they had both developed a severe anxiety disorder.</li><li>In 1949, she had signed a contract with Universal Studios and had changed her screen name to Piper Laurie. Over the next 6 years or so, she had acted in a few movies, and to enhance her image, Universal Studios had told gossip columnists that she used to bathe in milk and used to eat flower petals to protect her luminous skin.</li><li>In the mid-1950s, discouraged by the lack of substantial film roles, she had briefly moved to New York City to study acting and to seek work on the stage and in TV shows.</li><li>In 1962, she was named Harvard University’s ‘Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year’, awarded annually by the theatrical society members of the university to performers deemed to have made a lasting and impressive contribution to the world of entertainment.</li><li>In 2000, she had received the ‘Spirit of Hope Award’ in Korea for her service during the Korean War.</li><li>She was also a sculptor and her work based on marble and clay had often been exhibited.</li><p>Featured Image by Piper Laurie / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqmgqZ2iYrmiwdGinGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
