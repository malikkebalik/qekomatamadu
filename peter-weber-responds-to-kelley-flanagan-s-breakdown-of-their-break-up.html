Recently, Kelley Flanagan shared details about her breakup with Peter Weber when she appeared on the Chicks in the Office podcast on May 21, 2021. 
The couple had officially split in February 2021 after getting back together from breaking up in December 2020.  
Flanagan explained on the podcast how the couple wasn’t on the same page and how their break-up had ended badly. She not only talked about possible infidelities from Weber's side but also about how she did not appreciate the fact that he had announced the break-up even though she was not prepared."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She not only talked about possible infidelities from Weber's&nbsp;side but also about&nbsp;how she did not appreciate the fact that he had announced the break-up even though she was not prepared.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>But on May 27, Weber finally <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">shared</a> his side of the story on an episode of&nbsp;Bachelor In the City podcast&nbsp;while&nbsp;calling Flanagan’s post-split interview&nbsp;on the&nbsp;Chicks in the Office&nbsp;podcast calculative and disingenuous.&nbsp;</p><h2>Caught off Guard</h2><p>The&nbsp;Bachelor&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>alum admitted that he was caught off guard about the things Flagnan had said in the <a href=# rel=follow>podcast</a> and wanted to share his side of the story. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Weber started by stating that he was grateful for the 10 months he was with Flagnan and called it the best relationship he ever had.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He said he still cared deeply for his ex.&nbsp;And when they had no communication with each other, he asked one of her friends how she was doing. To which, her friend had replied that Flanagan wanted a grandiose gesture from Weber if&nbsp;he wanted to talk to her. That did not&nbsp;sit well with Weber.</p><p>He iterated that a relationship was about two people, and even though he understood most of their relationship was public, he still opined that some things should be kept personal. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He did not want the media to pick up on their private affairs&nbsp;and instead wanted to talk to Flanagan privately.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>She did not respond and instead went on record to talk about their relationship, but not to him, who was a core element in their relationship. This made Weber feel like Flanagan&nbsp;was riding out the break-up as long as possible.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Getting Closure</h2><p>Weber was frustrated because he believes Flanagan has so many inspirational stories that he was privy to during their relationship. And&nbsp;she should change her narrative to inspire women instead. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He also defended his Pokemon card habits, stating that he saw it as an investment, and while they were together, even Flanagan was into it.&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding going against her wishes to share the news of their split with the rest of the world on New Year’s Day, he explained he wanted to start the new year right and was done being a&nbsp;people pleaser.</p><p>He then shared that he flew out to New York and had a lengthy, heartfelt face-to-face talk about the two going their separate ways before returning to LA.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>When we got into the relationship, she did not let the public’s opinion and backlash affect her and gave me a second, a third chance, which I am grateful for.&nbsp;</p><p>Weber has already received&nbsp;the closure he needed and wished nothing but the best for Flanagan moving forward.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnoJrBpr6MsJybnaJir6Kvx56jqKpdoLKtuMSyZJ%2BkkaOuqK3NZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
