This was right before I got signed in 2019 and I did a fake Sprite commercial. It’s hilarious because we were in the back of an arena, you know, and they have those rooms with lockers and stuff in it with Sprite all over the room. I was like, ‘let’s do a sprite commercial.’ It was so random. I would never have thought that from that time, I would actually have a whole song in a Sprite campaign.”</span></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p><span>Filled with excitement, Leray went on about how she couldn’t wait for everyone to hear her self-reflective track “The One” and how she got the opportunity to work with multi-Grammy Award-winner</span><a href=#><span> James Blake</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>“So the Sprite song came out on June 10th and there’s another song that I’ve been teasing and that will be dropping next week that’s gonna be super fire. Oh my goodness,” she said. “So what makes it so dope is this Sprite record, that I </span><a href=#><span>tweeted</span></a><span> about from my account, is that I’m doing something new and I want everybody to get ready for the crossover. I feel like this record&nbsp; is super big and it’s something that I would use to say like, ‘Damn, I wish I could sing that song or I wish I was the one who sang this song.’ It reminds me so much of something like that and working with an amazing artist like James Blake was incredible.”</span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>New song for <a href=#>#SpriteLimelight</a> drops at MIDNIGHT!!

He loves it so much. I heard it and I can’t wait to hear when it’s on Apple Music because it just comes out different for me when I hear it like that for the first time.”</span></p><p><span>“The One” is not only another hot song in her growing collection of music, but the track is a foreshadowing of&nbsp; her evolution as an artist and is deeply personal. For Leray,&nbsp; she tapped into another dimension of her artistry for her contribution to the campaign.</span></p><p><span>“Normally, I always write from experience. I’m one of those people that you know, as an artist in this day and age, I use a lot of curse words and stuff with my potty mouth,” she laughed. “But I would say that this was a time when I didn’t want to curse. I felt like this was such a universal song and such a universal global moment, you know? You’ll find Sprite everywhere. No matter what city or country you’re in, you can find it. I just wanted the song to be on that level.”</span></p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Watch the visual to Coi Leray’s Sprite Limelight collab “The One” below:</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZnZn1xfo6toK2klWOwsLWMpZyrmalivK%2BvxGakmpyVYq5ussCknGaroKe2tbGMnKampZWnsKqty2alqK9dqLWmeceaqmaZXaeyoriMqKWe</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
