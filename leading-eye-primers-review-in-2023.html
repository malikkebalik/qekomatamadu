Not only does it ensure longer-lasting wear, but it also creates a barrier between your eyelid skin and the makeup, preventing sweat and oil from causing the colors to fade and crease. Primer specifically designed for application around the eyes may seem like an unnecessary step in your routine, but don’t be fooled into thinking that it is the same as a face primer. In this guide, we’ll uncover what makes the extra coat of cream so special. We’ll also talk about the top primer colors and help you pick a product most suitable for your skin.</span></p><h3><span>Benefits of Using Eye Primer</span></h3><p><span>If we haven’t made it obvious enough already, the main function of eye primer is to create a base for your eye makeup for long-lasting wear. It creates an oil-free grip for your eye makeup to stick, regardless of whether you are using powder, gel, or liquid products. Since it creates a barrier between naturally oily skin and the color product, it prevents creasing and smudging.</span></p><p><span>Another benefit of using a primer is that it accentuates the color of your eyeshadow and allows for more even application and blending for a truly vibrant and flawless look. Fewer touch-ups are needed, which means you can bat your lids with confidence all day long.</span></p><h3><span>Eye Primer vs. Face Primer</span></h3><p><span>Eye primer and <a href=#>face primer</a> formulas are somewhat different. Most face formulas include silicone to fill pores, blur imperfections, and provide silky smooth skin. This however would be counterproductive around your eyes since the smoothness doesn’t facilitate adherence of color products, which is why they fade and become creased.</span></p><p><span>As with face primer, concealer has the same kind of slippery base, making blending more difficult, leaving eye makeup feeling heavy, and forming creases as the oils in the skin interact with the creamy formula.</span></p><p><span>Eye primer formulas are specifically designed to counteract these problems by offering a slightly stickier cream, allowing products to adhere and stay put. In other words, eye primers provide more grip than slip.</span></p><p><span>Although eyebrow pencils can often double-up as eyeliner, and <a href=#>liquid eyeshadows</a> can be used as a highlighter, primer is one part of <a href=#>your makeup kit</a> that should only be used in the area it is specifically designed for.</span></p><p><span>Long-lasting formulas are best for oily skin, while individuals with dry skin can opt for a product that offers some hydration.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Tips for Applying Eye Primer</span></h3><li><span>You only need a very small amount of primer for your eye area. Think mustard seed size.</span></li><li><span>Always wash your hands before applying any makeup to your face, especially around your eyes.</span></li><li><span>Blend it over your entire eye area and a touch underneath if you are going to be applying any liner of shadow under your eye.</span></li><li><span>Your makeup goes directly over the primer. Use a finishing powder to lightly brush over any areas of primer that haven’t been covered with eyeshadow.</span></li><h3><span>How to Choose the Right Eye Primer Color for You</span></h3><h4><span>White primer</span></h4><p><span>White primer can be used on any skin tone and is ideal as a base for pastel shadows and colors you wish to intensify. Apply it with your finger and ensure a smooth, even coverage to avoid blotchy color application. Any color that you apply over the white will be more pronounced.</span></p><h4><span>Black primer</span></h4><p><span>Black primer is suitable for all skin tones and creates the best base for smoky eyes and metallic shades. Don’t be deterred when you see the black tube, as the color evens out to a dark grey when applied in a small amount. It adds depth and richness to smoky and metallic effects.</span></p><h4><span>Shimmer</span></h4><p><span>To provide any matt shade with a slight shimmery undertone, a shimmery primer can provide versatility to your eye kit. It brings brightness on its own and offers a touch of elegance to smoky eyes. You can even use a light shimmer formula as a highlighter or to brighten the eyes by applying it near the inner corners.</span></p><h4><span>Yellow primer</span></h4><p><span>Yellow eye primer is best for color correcting fair to medium complexions. Like black primer, it might seem a bit over-the-top at first glance, but once applied, it has the power to transform your lids. The yellow color neutralizes any uneven shades and redness, creating an even base for color application.</span></p><h4><span>Beige/brown neutrals</span></h4><p><span>For medium to dark complexions, these neutral shades act like color-correcting creams. They correct any uneven spots, create a neutral base for pronounced color, and provide a matte texture to prevent the skin's natural oils from causing uneven application and smudging.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGipnq6ZmsRwr86spJ6smZjAcLHYnmSpqpmisrN7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
