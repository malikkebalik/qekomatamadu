Despite the fact that he and Marivi are very low-key and live a life out of the spotlight, he has revealed that he has been married for decades.</p><p>He told PEOPLE in June 2022, “It was a lightning strike.” “When we were very young, she really captivated me. When we met that night, it was crystal evident that she was the woman I would spend the rest of my life with.</p><p>Even though the Oscar-nominated actor proposed to Marivi on their first date, they did not tie the knot until seven years later. “She insults me by claiming that I proposed to all the girls that night, which is not true!” he quipped at the time of the publication.</p><p>“Such things are possible. I did not want her to flee.” Although Andy frequently tweets about his girlfriend, Marivi keeps her Instagram account secret.</p><h2><span id=Have_Andy_and_Marivi_Children>Have Andy and Marivi, Children?</span></h2><p>Andy and Marivi have welcomed four children during the course of their forty-year marriage.
