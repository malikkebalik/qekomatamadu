'SOS' singer dated Drake, was rumored to have affair with Kehlani and Scott Sasso</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-09-11</div><p>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA: Neo-soul singer SZA (real name Solana Imani Rowe) is known for her alternative R&B style, which combines elements of soul, minimalist R&B, hip hop, indie rock, witch house, cloud rap, and chillwave. Her song, 'Good Days', rose to prominence on streaming platforms in 2021 and became her first solo top 10 success on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><p>The Grammy-winning singer, who is now on her SOS Tour, opened up about stardom and its drawbacks, as well as her present romantic situation. SZA recently had a conversation with <a href=# rel=nofollow>ELLE magazine</a>, where she stated, "I do miss my ex." The singer of 'Good Days' has always been a sort of dating enigma. SZA is silent when it comes to discussing her private life. Although she has never been out in the open, the pop star often addresses relationships through her music.</p><p>Reportedly, SZA is now single, and she isn't romantically involved with anyone. She had a few relationships in the past, but neither was she married nor did she have children.</p><h2 class=split>Kehlani</h2><p>When leaving eateries in LA, SZA and Kehlani&nbsp;were once spotted holding hands. Kehlani, who publicly came out as a lesbian or, in her own words, a "gay gay" on TikTok, was being paired with SZA due to their undoubtedly magnetic chemistry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/f6603563-43ba-4497-a40a-48c54a28995f.1403365822><p>On April 22, Lizzo's Instagram stories showed SZA and Kehlani hanging out with her. Later, the group also dined at the renowned 'Nice Guy' restaurant in West Hollywood. The R&B artists gave off the impression of being close when they exited 'Nice Guy' holding hands, and the Internet is live for those friendship ideals. Although it's unclear whether Kehlani and SZA were dating, their fans would dearly love for it to happen.</p><p>Fans went into frenzy at the sight of SZA and Kehlani holding hands (again) at Rihanna's Met Gala afterparty. The lifelong pals had previously been open about their fledgling relationship, including making cameos on one other's social media accounts. But nothing suggests that their relationship is anything other than platonic.</p><h2 class=split>Drake</h2><p>As per <a href=# rel=nofollow>People</a>, SZA admitted that she dated Drake in the 2000s, although she claims that Drake's timeline is somewhat incorrect. The two were once romantically related, but SZA, 33, clarified on social media that their relationship didn't involve "anything underage or creepy."</p><p>Drake claimed that he dated SZA 12 years ago in his featured verse of the new song 'Mr Right Now' by 21 Savage and Metro Boomin, which was released in 2020. Drake's verse reads, "Yeah, said she wanna f--- to some SZA, wait / 'Cause I used to date SZA back in '08."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/1d9f3ac1-7714-49f2-af49-bd65eb5d9e21.1350328656><p>"So It was actually 2009 lol ... in this case a year of poetic rap license mattered lol," the 'Prom' singer tweeted at the time. "I think he jus innocently rhymed 08 w wait. Anybody who really knows me and was around during this time can confirm ... it's all love all peace." In a different tweet, SZA stated, "I just didn't want anybody thinking anything underage or creepy was happening. Completely innocent. Lifetimes ago."</p><p>It didn't take long for fans to conduct some research and, oddly, some math. On social media, fans and users started speculating that SZA might have only been 17 at the time of the relationship. Fortunately, SZA quickly intervened to provide some much-needed explanation. The singer jokingly claimed that Drake was using "poetic license" and that it was actually 2009 and not 2008.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>So It was actually 2009 lol üôÉ.. in this case a year of poetic rap license mattered ü•¥lol I think he jus innocently rhymed 08 w wait . Anybody who really knows me and was around during this time can confirm.. it‚Äôs all love all peace ü§ùüíéüí´ .</p>‚Äî SZA (@sza) <a href=#>October 5, 2020</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Scott Sasso</h2><p>Having said that, there aren't many details available about her previous romantic relationships. SZA is said to have dated Scott Sasso, but she never spoke explicitly about their relationship. Sasso is a well-known specialist in the apparel sector.</p><h2 class=split>'You don‚Äôt get to block me on everything'</h2><p>SZA likens her approach in an interview with ELLE to the scene in the movie '8 Mile', where Eminem's character enters the rap battle and seizes control of anything that would otherwise be used as a slur against him. He responded, "I am white and I do live in a trailer park with my mom." SZA claims that, in her opinion, "I did deserve less. I have did terrible things. I do miss my ex. I do got acne, I got eczema, like whatever the f***."</p><p>SZA reveals that she told the crowd that her ex had blocked her but doesn't see the issue with it because it is the truth. "My ex‚Äôs father just texted me and was like, ‚ÄòMy son is really hurt about what you said about him to the crowd in Portland'," she continued.</p><p>"You don‚Äôt get to block me on everything. Tell our mutual friends terrible things about me like I‚Äôm a monster, or whatever the case may be. And then I don‚Äôt get to speak my peace in my way. You go do your healing and I‚Äôll do mine."</p><h2 class=split>'Nobody gets me'</h2><p>Her music thrives in the anxious acceptances that must be made before you can move on to the healing, whether she's singing about a desire to choose violence over therapy ('Kill Bill'), recalling past sexcapades at the MGM hotel ('Nobody Gets Me'), or the desperation you feel when you realize you've given all of yourself to a loser ('Special').</p><p>SZA's breakup ballad 'Nobody Gets Me' captures her emotions during the final moments of her engagement to her ex-fiance, who she believed at the time was the only one who genuinely understood her, she told <a href=# rel=nofollow>HOT 97</a>. SZA expertly uses her vocal prowess to arouse feelings of nostalgia and melancholy, which are frequent feelings experienced after a separation.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjKyxmmWUlsGqusZmqqirXai2r7PEq2SdmaSasW6w0ZqinmWnlsBuvtSmpqudlGLBsHnHmq2eZZGbs6K10WauoqyYYrimtMuapaJlkaOxbr%2FCqKutZaOWwLS7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
