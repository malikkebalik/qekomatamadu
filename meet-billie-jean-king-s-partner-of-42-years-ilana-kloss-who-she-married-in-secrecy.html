In 1973, King <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.billiejeanking.com/biography/>founded</a> the Women's Tennis Association and became the group's first president.</p><p class=dh>King also gained international fame beating tennis player and self-proclaimed chauvinist Bobby Riggs in the "Battle of the Sexes." The match took place after Riggs claimed that the women's game was inferior to men's.</p><p class=dh>The infamous match between King and Riggs became the subject of a film four years ago, starring Emma Stone and Steve Carrell. It highlighted King's winning streak against her opponent: 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.</p><p class=dh>Outside her popularity in tennis, the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative founder was known for her struggles with her sexuality. Growing up in a religious household, King lived with homophobic parents.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MARRYING LARRY KING</strong></p><p class=dh>In 1982, King, then 21, married her college sweetheart, Larry King, then 22.

She only acknowledged herself as gay at 51. She denied her sexuality for years because she was not comfortable with it at that time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/87c4ade4e924e7e30d971dc03108a045.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Billie Jean King at Wimbledon with her husband Karry King at Margaret Court on July 6, 1972 in London England. | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MEETING ILANA KLOSS</strong></p><p class=dh>After her divorce from her ex-husband, King developed a relationship with South African tennis player Ilana Kloss for 42 years.
