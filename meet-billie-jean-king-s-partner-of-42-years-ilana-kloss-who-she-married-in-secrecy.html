In 1973, King <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.billiejeanking.com/biography/>founded</a> the Women's Tennis Association and became the group's first president.</p><p class=dh>King also gained international fame beating tennis player and self-proclaimed chauvinist Bobby Riggs in the "Battle of the Sexes." The match took place after Riggs claimed that the women's game was inferior to men's.</p><p class=dh>The infamous match between King and Riggs became the subject of a film four years ago, starring Emma Stone and Steve Carrell. It highlighted King's winning streak against her opponent: 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.</p><p class=dh>Outside her popularity in tennis, the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative founder was known for her struggles with her sexuality. Growing up in a religious household, King lived with homophobic parents.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MARRYING LARRY KING</strong></p><p class=dh>In 1982, King, then 21, married her college sweetheart, Larry King, then 22.

She only acknowledged herself as gay at 51.
