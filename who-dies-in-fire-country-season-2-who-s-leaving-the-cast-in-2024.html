Keep reading to find out.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Fire Country</a> is CBS’ drama series centered on firefighters and inmates at the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (also known as Cal Fire). It stars Max Thieriot as Bode Donovan, a young convict with a troubled past who joins the inmate firefighter program to redeem himself and shorten his prison sentence. Bode is assigned to his hometown in Northern California, where he must work alongside his former friends and other inmates as they fight wild fires that plague the region. Thieriot co-created the show based off of his own experience growing up in fire country.</p><p>The Cal Fire crew puts their lives at risk in every episode, but the upcoming Season 2 episode “This Storm Will Pass” will see the team face one of their biggest challenges yet — and it may claim the life of one of their own. Is someone going to die on Fire Country? We have all the details below.</p><h2>Who dies in Fire Country Season 2?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Fire-Country.jpg alt="Fire Country" width=1195 height=697 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Who dies in Fire Country Season 2? Although we don’t know for sure, the entire team is in danger in the upcoming Season 2 episode and promos suggest that someone might not make it out alive.&nbsp;Per the episode’s official synopsis, “The station 42 crew must protect Edgewater and take cover when an extremely rare and dangerous fire tornado leaves lives in peril.”</p><p>A fire tornado is a whirlwind induced by a fire and often composed of flame or ash. One <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">promo</a> of the episode shows the tornado barreling through Edgewater and ripping up everything in its wake. To make matters worse, Bode is still in serious danger following the ambulance crash that took place at the end of Episode 4.&nbsp; <a href=# rel=noopener>New paramedic Diego</a> (Rafael de la Fuente) was driving Bode, who had suffered injuries during a chemical explosion, to the hospital when a tree fell into the rode and caused him to crash. Bode now appears to be in trapped in the overturned ambulance and handcuffed to it.&nbsp;Over Vince’s (Billy Burke) walkie talkie, Diego can be heard frantically telling the squad to “hurry” as they send help. Toward the end of the promo, the words “everything will change” flash across the screen while dramatic music plays.</p><p>Another <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">promo</a> features the sound of a heart rate monitor increasing, presumably as someone flatlines. Between the tornado and the ambulance crash, almost everyone’s lives appear to be at stake. Our protagonist and his ex-girlfriend Cara (Sabina Gadecki), who is also stuck in the bus, seem to be in the most danger, though.</p><p>Fire Country&nbsp;has killed off main characters before (RIP Fiona), so the show could be gearing up for another death. If Cara were to die, Bode would have to really step up for Genevieve, the daughter he just learned he has. We can see the show going that route and exploring how Bode will adapt to being a single father. The new paramedic could also be on the chopping block since he was driving the truck and appeared very distressed in his call for help. Diego is now engaged to Gabriela (Stephanie Arcila), Bode’s former love interest, and just before the ambulance crash, Bode admitted that he still loved her. Diego getting killed off would certainly make this love triangle a lot messier, as Gabriela’s grief would make it difficult for her to jump back into things with Bode.</p><p>Viewers will just have to tune in to see who survives this high-stakes episode.</p><p>Fire Country Season 2 airs on CBS on Fridays at 9 p.m. EST. New episodes are available to stream on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Paramount+</a> the next day.</p><p><b>For more on&nbsp;Fire Country, check out this gallery on <a href=# rel=noopener>the cast’s real-life families</a>.&nbsp;</b></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmrKeRpcBwusSwqmhvYmmCeYSOsJ%2BoZZSesrR5xaKpnmWTpMKvwNGyZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
