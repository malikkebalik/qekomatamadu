Vin, also fondly called Dom, started his career as a stage actor, spending his entire teenage in theatres. It was Vin’s home production movie Multi-Facial which grabbed director <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Steven Spielberg</a>‘s attention and he was so impressed that he re-wrote part of his in-process movie <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> just to have Vin in it. This basically marked his entry in Hollywood.</p><p>Vin’s other precious attribute is his voice, which he had lent in many movies most notable being that of Groot in <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> (2014). Though known for action movies, he has been well accepted in comic roles too and fans wouldn’t be surprised to see him in a super-hero avatar in the coming future.</p><h3>Born Name</h3><p>Mark Sinclair Vincent</p><h3>Nick Name</h3><p>Diesel, Bouncer, Dom</p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async title=vin-diesel-hot-body src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/vin-diesel-hot-body.jpg alt width=540 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></h3><h3>Sun Sign</h3><p>Cancer</p><h3>Born Place</h3><p>New York City, New York, USA</p><h3>Nationality</h3><p><img decoding=async title=American src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/United-States.png alt=American width=64 height=47 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Education</h3><p>Vin Diesel studied theater at&nbsp;<strong>Hunter College</strong>,&nbsp;New York, USA.</p><h3>Occupation</h3><p>Actor, director, producer, and screenwriter</p><h3>Family</h3><ul><li><strong>Mother</strong> –&nbsp;Delora Sherleen (Sinclair) Vincent (Astrologer and Psychiatrist)</li><li><strong>Siblings</strong> – Paul (Fraternal Twin Brother) (Film Editor), Samantha Vincent (Younger Sister),&nbsp;Tim Vincent (Younger Brother)</li><li><strong>Others</strong> –&nbsp;Irving H.
