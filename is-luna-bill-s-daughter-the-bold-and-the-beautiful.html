 3 Likes GiGi44  January 9, 2024, 3:57pm 2  Seems they are going there. I find it absurd. Why does he need another long lost kid, and if he and Poppy had a one night stand, would she not remember who she was with when she got pregnant?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Either way, I don’t consider it high drama. It might be interesting if Luna is Bill’s daughter, considering RJ hates Bill and Bill is going to be way less than thrilled about Luna hooking herself to The Dressmaker’s son.</p><p><span class=post-likes>7 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>GiGi44</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>January 9, 2024, 8:14pm <span itemprop=position>4</span></span><p>You are right, that would bring some drama.

Fine by me. I want to see more of Bill but not with Liam the whiny puke. I think it could be interesting seeing Bill build a relationship with his new daughter and rekindle a romance with Poppy. Then they can just get rid of Liam.

I really don’t know how DD can continue on with yet another stupid plot line that he has already done to death. Why does everyone have to be related on this show?</p><p><span class=post-likes>5 Likes</span></p><p>I think much like JMW, DD is very family oriented and enjoys the flexibility in scheduling so he puts up with the nonsense.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Mr_Bob</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>January 10, 2024, 10:30am <span itemprop=position>14</span></span><p>I Hope she is not Bill’s, but that is exactly why she probably will be his.</p><p>The cast is already too “related.” Rather than establishing a separate family that could date and marry around the “limited” cast freely, they have now most likely brought in another Spencer. If they just have to put boring Poppy with Bill, they could have them marry and just make them Spencers that way, but if they make Bill the father, it might end up being limiting.</p><p>If they would allow for a larger cast, they could bring in as many kids in for Bill as they want, if they want to keep making him look nasty, but the cast is ridiculously small.</p><p>If she does not end up being Bill’s, they could age up Will and make a Spencer/Forrester rivalry. With the way the show loves triangles so much, they are inevitable, so they could have Will fight against RJ (though I would rather he go far away) for Luna. Well that can’t happen if she is his sister.</p><p>What other other guys are there on the show that she could date in her age group to make for an interesting plot? She has already tasted wealth, so I guess she will just go from Forrester to Forrester.</p><p>I would rather they bring in an interesting male to be her dad. That could have been a man to pair with Taylor, since they wouldn’t put her with Bill, but they would rather get rid of Taylor than go there so nevermind…</p><p>Regardless of all that, Bill having another child that miraculously finds him in adulthood is already an overused plot device on this show. If they don’t change it up, I may have to question their creativity or something…</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Cooper</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>January 10, 2024, 8:31pm <span itemprop=position>15</span></span><p>DD also has his first grandchild on the way, due in 2024, and he may like some time to play grandpa.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Cooper</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>January 10, 2024, 8:34pm <span itemprop=position>16</span></span><p>The everybody’s-a-Spencer is a particular problem with the kiddos on the show right now. The only one who doesn’t have a Spencer parent is Hayes. Douglas’ mother Caroline was a Spencer, and Kelly and Beth both have Liam as a biological father. Hayes is the only one who isn’t related to a Spencer somehow. If the show were to last that long, and I doubt that it will, dating would be very tricky.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>Yeah, it is so cute seeing how much of a family man DD is.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>It stinks that we lost Wyatt because it would have been good to see how Wyatt reacted to having a sister he never knew about, but if this brings more storyline for Bill I don’t mind.
