Joe talks about his sister, saying, “I’m finally at a better place with Teresa and Joe.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Teresa also stays true to what she said about wanting to be there for <strong>Jacqueline Laurita</strong>, and went to Jacqueline’s house to help her write a speech about son Nicholas for an autism event that she’s super nervous about. Teresa confesses to the audience she’s helping Jacqueline out, because Jacqueline “has apologized for what she’s done.” So generous of you, Teresa!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Melissa also has album producers come to her home to listen to a new song of hers, but judging from the looks on their faces, she needs a whole lotta work, saying that family can’t be a factor in hindering her success. When they invite her to their Orlando compound — so glam! — for more production meetings, she ponders her choices, saying, “Singing is my passion, but I’m a mother first.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>Kathy Wakile</strong>‘s cannoli business venture is also weighing on her mind, so when she has an event at Dylan’s Candy Bar in NYC, she’s upset when her family shows up late to the cannoli tasting and demonstration, repeatedly complaining that she’s always there for the family — on time — when they ask her to be. All goes well, and even Queen Teresa is semi-impressed, scoffing, “They are edible — I’m pretty impressed.” Poor Kathy — looks like she’s the only one who took equestrian therapy to heart!</p><h3><span>Teresa Giudice Is Blamed For The Gorga’s Cheating Rumor</span></h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Peaceful lives take a turn for the scandalous when Melissa and Joe go to dinner and spy gossipmonger&nbsp;<strong>Penny</strong> at the bar of the restaurant by her long blonde hair extensions, who was thought to be behind the rumors that there was cheating in their marriage.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>They decide to confront her — what else? — and learn that Teresa was behind spreading the rumor all along, telling Penny to confront Joe at the party about Melissa’s ex-boyfriend, feeding her info, and then also telling her to stop the rumors. Penny, her husband and Teresa are clearly all in this together — but Penny is still a little too shady to be seen as a totally trustworthy source.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Looks like nothing can stay peaceful for long with this family. What do YOU think, <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Did Teresa really spread the rumors, or is Penny lying? Sound off!</p><h3>WATCH: Melissa & Joe Gorga Confront Cheating Rumors</h3><p id=content-paragraph-10><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hl-yt-subscribe.png alt="Subscribe to me on YouTube" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>—&nbsp;Ivy Jacobson</strong></p><h3>More ‘RHONJ’ News:</h3><li>‘RHONJ’ Recap: Teresa Giudice Denies Gorga Cheating Rumors</li><li>‘RHONJ’ Recap: Teresa Insults Jacqueline’s Autistic Son</li><li><a href=#>‘RHONJ’ Recap: Teresa Implies Jacqueline’s Son’s Autism Is Bad Karma</a></li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWljZH16e5BuZqugn6O3brPOq56aq12Ytaat06KloGWkmr%2Bmv8Bmqp6Zo6S7boGMnqeiq5%2BZsm59lWapnpuRpXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
