The duo appeared to smile and chat with several people who recognized them, later stopping at a store to pick up some goods which remained concealed in a plastic bag.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The trip comes just under three weeks after both Amy and T.J. were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>released from their contracts at ABC News</a> following an investigation into their relationship. “After several productive conversations with Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes, about different options, we all agreed it’s best for everyone that they move on from ABC News,” the news division said to <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> in an emailed statement on Jan. 27. “We recognize their talent and commitment over the years and are thankful for their contributions,” the Disney-owned network added at the time. A day later, Amy and T.J. were once again seen packing on the PDA on a quick trip to Los Angeles before returning home to NYC where they appear to be residing at his Manhattan apartment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH1ze5ByZpqlqWK%2FsK7AnJ9mmpmgtq%2B1jKSgrKuVqHq1toyhpqWllah6rrHXopqoZaCdvLW70mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
