“Well, I only have one sexy gift idea, and I kind of have to demonstrate it,” Fineman told “Weekend Update” anchors Michael Che and Colin Jost."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Then, with a touch of finesse, she elegantly shed the crimson robe, revealing the very ensemble that Stiles herself adorns for her grand finale in the movie. Fineman meticulously dissected the entire film plot to Jost, step by step, while gracefully dancing, as Che relaxed and enjoyed his popcorn.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-julia-stiles-save-the-last-dance-s-recreation-thrilled-the-saturday-night-live-studio-audience>Julia Stiles ‘Save the Last Dance’s Recreation Thrilled the ‘Saturday Night Live’ Studio Audience</h2><p>The summary kept going, building up the anticipation until bam! Stiles herself strutted onto the stage, causing the crowd to erupt with a mix of shock and excitement. In perfect harmony, Fineman and Stiles flawlessly executed the choreographed number with their cane back chairs. The grand finale was a triumphant fist-bump that brought about a standing ovation from the studio audience.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"></figure><p>Released back in 2001, Save the Last Dance is a teen dance film produced by MTV Films and directed by Thomas Carter. The movie follows Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas as a teen couple in Chicago. The duo work together to prepare Stiles’ character for a dance audition at Juilliard School. Sara, played by Stiles, impresses with her captivating dance routine in the 2001 film. Ultimately, the dance earned her acceptance into the esteemed Julliard School of Performing Arts in New York City. Of course, this is the same dance SNL lampooned last night.</p><p>The film received mixed reviews from critics but was a box office success, grossing an impressive $131.7 million worldwide. Remarkably, it achieved this while staying within its modest $13 million budget.</p><p>Meanwhile, Adam Driver returned to host the latest episode of SNL on Saturday, marking his fourth time in the role. Olivia Rodrigo joined him as the musical guest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminlKS6psDEq2Wcp51kwbd7ya6jopldqMGquMSsZKudk6eyosDErGScpJGowKqvjKyYr51dqbWmecuaqq1llJa7pLGMpqamnZ6perC6jKyYra2ima66ec2inqGsXaG2t7GO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
