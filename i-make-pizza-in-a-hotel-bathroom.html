After kneading the dough and letting it sit, Barfly rolls it into pizza shape using the hotel’s ice bucket.</p><p>At last, his suite invention is ready to cook, which the hotel hacker accomplishes with a hot plate and pan. “Grease that s–t,” commands Barfly as he heats both sides of the dough in the pan before topping the pie with sauce, cheese and pepperoni.</p><p>At one point, after noticing that the cheese is a bit flaccid, the bidet gourmet crisps the top of it with a “$10 heat gun” he brought along for his hotel stay.</p><p>The clip concludes with Barfly slapping the pizza on the bathroom counter and then gobbling it in the hotel room like a fugitive on the lam.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The hotel hacker’s potty pie didn’t sit well with the TikTok commentariat. <span class=credit>TikTok/barfly7777</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The guest cooked the pizza on a hot plate. <span class=credit>TikTok/barfly7777</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Add seasonings “to cover up the taste of bathroom,” the lavatory cooking tutorial instructs. <span class=credit>TikTok/barfly7777</span></figure><p>Unsurprisingly, TikTok viewers were revolted by the potty pizza.

He said that while he liked some of Barfly’s improvisations — such as the medicine bottle — he didn’t approve of the setting, as hotel bathrooms are “a lot dirtier than you think, especially the sinks.”</p><p>“Toilet in the background, not eating whatsoever,” the epicure declared.</p><p>Indeed, hotels aren’t the sanitary bastions they’re billed as. A <a href=#>2020 survey by travel service UpgradedPoints</a> found that even five-star accommodations are cesspools of microbes, with the average hotel elevator button boasting 737 times more germs than a household toilet seat.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">“Poo poo” platter: The bathroom pizza is slapped on the counter. <span class=credit>TikTok/barfly7777</span></figure><p>Meanwhile, the average hotel door handle had a whopping 918 times more bugs than a household toilet seat, per the study.</p><p>Then again, potty pizza still might be preferable to the <a href=#>food at some hotels</a>, where hygiene standards are apparently less than stellar.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGtmaXFfnnqurcqeZKmhqq%2BubrXNZphmoJ%2Bpsq15wZqroaqfpLpw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
