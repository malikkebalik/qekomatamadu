The Scottish actress walked down memory lane as she recalled the pre-pandemic filming days with her distinguished female co-stars, including Angela Bassett, Michelle Yeoh, Freya Allan, Lena Headey, and Carla Gugino.
She stated that among all the movies she had done yet — the notable ones being Guardians of the Galaxy and Jumanji — Gunpowder Milkshake was the most fun-filled movie, and rightfully so."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Besides recreational activities, she equally enjoyed her time at the sets, though it included intense training for fight scenes.&nbsp;</p><p>The film's director Navot Papushado didn't want action doubles for the actresses. Hence,&nbsp;Gillan had a three-week intensive training for boxing and fight choreography. In her own words, the training was demanding, but she loved it anyway.&nbsp;</p><h2>Karen Gillan's Role In 'Gunpowder Milkshake'</h2><p>Gunpowder Milkshake <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>is&nbsp;a two-hour action-thriller, somewhat of a female version of <a href=# rel=follow>John Wick</a>, with Gillan&nbsp;filling the slot of <a href=# rel=follow>Keanu Reeves</a>.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the movie, the Inverness native portrayed Sam, a young yet impossibly strong assassin who had not seen her mother Scarlet, portrayed by Lena Headey, for 15 years.</p><p>As a hitwoman, she handles&nbsp;all kinds of missions, but her entire world changes&nbsp;once she saves&nbsp;an eight-year-old Emily, played by Chloe Coleman, going against her firm.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Her absentee mother suddenly appears in her life and helps her fight the men-filled&nbsp;ruthless crime syndicate. The movie is packed with some violent moves and lots of gunfires. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><a href=# rel=follow>Gillan</a> acknowledged&nbsp;the rogue nature of the movie in her interview, but the 33-year-old&nbsp;also shared that the action-thriller was&nbsp;popcorn-worthy for its women stunts and emotionality.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the male stars cast to grace the project are&nbsp;Ralph Ineson,&nbsp;Ed Birch,&nbsp;Paul Giamatti, and&nbsp;Samuel Anderson.&nbsp;</p><h2>'Gunpowder Milkshake's Ratings and Reviews&nbsp;</h2><p>Gunpowder Milkshake's filming was done before the COVID-19 pandemic caused lockdown, but it affected the release date. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>As a result, the movie got released in the United States through Netflix on&nbsp;July 14, 2021, two years after it started filming in June 2019. And since its premiere, the film&nbsp;has been met with mixed reviews.</p><p>While it has been&nbsp;highly lauded for its star-studded cast and over-the-top violence, it has also been criticized for improper and unequal character developments. Vulture <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">marked the shortcoming</a>&nbsp;as:</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Sure, they (female stars excluding Headley and Gillan)&nbsp;get two fight scenes in the third act of the film, but they are primarily side characters meant to support and engender the richer story Sam is given.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Also, not everyone was glad to see Gillan with superhuman powers. As depicted in the trailer, she doesn't even flinch when shot in her arms.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Instead, she gives an annoyed, intense look.&nbsp;Not at all a relatable stance for&nbsp;a&nbsp;typical human character.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, the movie is <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">doing well</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;70%&nbsp;on Tomatometer of Rotten Tomatoes. And, it is rated 5.8 on a scale of 10 on IMDb, as of this time of writing.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKORp7Kvecaio6WZnmK0trrPqK6dnaJiuqq4yqyfmqOVY7W1ucs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
