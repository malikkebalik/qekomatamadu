The 32-year-old alleged killer reportedly murdered the young boys, aged 3, 4, and 7, on Thursday afternoon, June 15, as their mother made an unsuccessful attempt to rescue them. He is now facing an aggravated murder charge and is placed at the Clermont County Jail on a bond of $20 million.</p><p>Though Chad has reportedly confessed to murders before the authorities and claimed to plan them for months, his father Keith Doerman said that he and his wife have “no answers” to the brutality as he noted that his son “just snapped." The 59-year-old stated as per the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, “There was something going on in his life that he couldn't handle anymore. I can't talk to him, they aren't letting me talk to him so I don't have any answers. He probably hid a lot of stuff from me.”</p><h2 class=split>‘The story was wrong’</h2><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Hisham Awartani: GoFundMe set up for Palestinian Ivy League student shot in Vermont and tragically paralyzed from chest down</a></p><p>Keith also mentioned that he met Chad just a few days before the killings. He added, “He seemed fine. He was a jokester and a fun-loving guy.” Besides, the accused’s father declared that his son had no past criminal record or mental issues. Reports, however, said he once faced a domestic violence charge in 2010 after allegedly strangling Keith. But the elder Doerman told The New York Post, “That was not true. The story was wrong and the judge dismissed the case.”</p><p>Meanwhile, regarding the recent accusations, Clermont County’s chief prosecutor of Municipal Court, David Gast, said, “The trauma that this man has inflicted on his family, community, law enforcement, first responders, and all the rest of us is unspeakable. There has been a full admission in this case, the case is still new we’re still discovering facts. But the evil horror of what we know is impossible to process.”</p><p>He added, “This was the man that every day they [the children] woke up looking to for protection, love, and guidance in all things. He was their world, he was their guardian and he executed them in cold blood.”</p><h2 class=split>‘No one should have to go through this’</h2><p>A <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GoFundMe</a> has now been started to help the boys’ mother. It says, “Help my sister bury her children. My sister lost her three amazing babies yesterday. Nothing will make this better, it will never be okay. But please if you can find it in your heart to help relieve the financial burden of this tragedy, please donate. No one should have to go through this.”</p><p>The fundraiser has received a lot of supportive messages. A person said, “I wish the best for you! I’m so sorry for what happened, your boys and you did not deserve that. I’m sorry for your loss and the pain you now suffer.” Another person commented, “No words can ever make this better or help you heal. I have been praying for you and your family every night, I can’t imagine what your heart is going through right now. We are still praying and thinking of you, your daughter, and your boys.”</p><p>“May those beautiful babies rest peacefully in heaven. I hope justice is brought down hard and swiftly on the person responsible. Your family is in my prayers. I’m so sorry for your loss,” the third one added.</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Manuel Rocha: Former US ambassador arrested over accusations of secretly serving as agent for Cuba</a></p><p><a href=#>Arizona student seriously injured in 'promposal'-gone-wrong sues school for $1M</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRom5iWsW6wzp6pppmeYrOiwMeeqWanlmK6orqMsJ%2BoZaOdvLV5x6KqZqufo8Buv8CyqmaglWK3tr%2FTZqqnmaClsqV5wa6rZq%2BRqHqntc2eZLCdlaB6o7HFqKmeZZ2qv6Wx0aw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
