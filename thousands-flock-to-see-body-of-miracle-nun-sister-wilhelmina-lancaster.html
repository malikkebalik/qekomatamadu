Just very reverent.”</p><p>Lancaster was buried in a simple wooden coffin without any embalming four years ago, according to a statement from the Benedictines of Mary, Queen of Apostles.</p><p>When the Benedictine nuns exhumed their founder last week, they expected to find bones in her coffin but were instead shocked to see her fully intact body and “a perfectly preserved religious habit.”</p><p>The nuns had hoped to keep their discovery private, but an internal email about the matter was posted online and the news spread and soon made headlines.</p><p>Many Catholics believe that Lancaster’s lack of decay is a miracle and that she could be a modern-day saint.</p><p>“It just felt like the presence of God was there as soon as I went into the monastery. It’s a true miracle. I really think that,” Rita Cospelich, a visitor from Blue Springs, Missouri, told FOX4. “God works in strange ways with miracles.”</p><p>However, the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph has approached the reported science-denying matter with caution.</p><p>“The condition of the remains of Sister Wilhelmina Lancaster has understandably generated widespread interest and raised important questions,” the diocese said. “At the same time, it is important to protect the integrity of the mortal remains of Sister Wilhelmina to allow for a thorough investigation.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Lancaster’s body shows no signs of decay despite her dying in 2019 at the age of 95. <span class=credit>AP Photo/Charlie Riedel</span></figure><p>“Incorruptibility has been verified in the past, but it is very rare. There is a well-established process to pursue the cause for sainthood, but that has not been initiated in this case yet,” the diocese added.</p><p>The process to investigate sainthood can only begin five years after a person’s death, and Lancaster has only been dead four years, the Benedictines of Mary, Queen of Apostles, also said.</p><p>Scientists are also wary of the supposed miracle.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Some Catholics have called for Lancaster to be made a saint. <span class=credit>AP Photo/Charlie Riedel</span></figure><p>Human remains decay at different rates depending on a number of variables, and a lack of decomposition even years later isn’t all that rare, according to Rebecca George, an anthropology instructor at Western Carolina University in North Carolina.</p><p>“Typically, when we bury people, we don’t exhume them. We don’t get to look at them a couple years out,” George said. “With 100 years, there might be nothing left. But when you’ve got just a few years out, this is not unexpected.”</p><p>With Post wires</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j25ma3FfqbWwwdKapZ2rXZu5sK%2FKZquoZaOasm6uzp2wZqeWYrqqvsCco55lnqq7br%2FIrKueql2stq20xKWkoqaRYrmiusKaqq2domQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
