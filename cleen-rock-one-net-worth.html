Four years after that, he took a big step in his career by opening a tattoo studio, Topnotch Tattoos, in his hometown. However having decided that he would rather put himself up to a bigger challenge, Cleen sold his Elgin studio and opened three other tattoo shops in Las Vegas, Nevada. He stated that his goal was to make quality tattoos, and according to his customers, he is succeeding in his plan.</p><p>Cleen Rock One caught the attention of the media and rose to wider fame when he competed in the reality television show ‘’Ink Master’’ in 2014, originally broadcast on Spike Network and created by J Holland Moore. It is focused on finding the best tattoo artist amongst the participants of each season. The series features the most skilled tattoo artists from across the US, who compete for the prize of $100,000 and the title of ‘’INK MASTER’’. Their work is judged and evaluated by tattoo world legends, <a href=#>Chris Nunez</a> and <a href=#>Oliver Peck</a>. When it comes to the reception of the show, it received mostly positive reviews, and received a DGA nomination for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Reality Programs. The series premiered on 17 January 2012, with the episode entitled ‘’Fresh Meat’’ and as of today is still running, into its 10th season. Cleen Rock One was a participant in its fifth season, and finished it off as one of the runners-up, losing to Jason Clay Dunn, and ending with ‘’New Year’s Ink’’. He didn’t make any appearances in the following season, but competed once again in the seventh season of the show, this time as a veteran tattoo artist. In this new project, he achieved notable success by winning two tattoos-of-the- day, two face-offs, and again finished the competition as a runner up, second only to Anthony Michaels.</p><p>As of today, he still works as a tattoo artist, and thanks to his talent and the success of ‘’Ink Master’’, he has made a name and brand for himself. Cleen now owns three tattoo shops in Las Vegas – Chrome Gypsy, Golden Skull and Nevada Tattoo Company and is known for his new school artwork.</p><p>When it comes to his personal life, Cleen Rock One is dating Megan Jean Morris, his ‘’Ink Masters’’ colleague. He is active on Instagram and has an army of over 191,000 followers. He often puts up his artwork on his social media accounts.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=10.781990521327><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>August 6, 1977</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Elgin, Illinois USA</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Profession</td><td>Professional Tattoo Artist</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Megan Jean Morris</td></tr><tr readability=0.28571428571429><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/cleen_rock_one?lang=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/cleenrockone/?hl=en</a></td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Movies</td><td>Ink Master (TV Series 2012– ), Ink Master Redemption: Coach Cleen (2017)</td></tr><tr readability=16><td>TV Shows</td><td>Meet Ink Master Finalist Cleen Rock One - Ink Master, (Season 7, Youtube, 2016), "Ink Master" Hallowink (2015), Cleen Rock One: Name Origins (Youtube, 2014), Cleen Rock One Tattoos Giant Hannya On My Back (Youtube, 2016), Cleen Rock One to the Rescue | Ink Master: Redemption (Season 4, 2017, Youtube...</td></tr></table><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjpyjnp2eYr%2Bwr8pmpqedXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
