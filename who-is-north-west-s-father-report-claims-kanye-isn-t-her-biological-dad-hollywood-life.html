And he sure is handsome and would make beautiful babies! North’s daddy definitely is a man of color so the NFL star could be a candidate.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Her most recent ex would have been <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kris Humphries</a></strong>, 31, who Kim was infamously married to for 72 days in 2011.

After all, they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>still weren’t divorced</a> when Kim became pregnant shortly after she started dating Kanye. And what about her sex tape partner <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ray J</a></strong>, 35?
