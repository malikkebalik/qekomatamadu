Earle's candid approach to her acne led to her choice to not only get breast implants but also to document everything. During her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Stern Show</a> debut, she said of getting elective surgery, "It's just a personal choice, and I think if there's something you want to do for yourself, then do it," before explaining why she let her followers in on it,&nbsp;"I would never go on the internet and lie or not say something... like, 'Oh yeah, they just grew overnight?'" No, so got to keep it real.”</p><p>When it came to her breast implants, Earle said she was open with her followers about an augmentation. This is because she didn’t want to promote false standards. “I don’t want to tell other girls who watch this,” she explained, "I know it seems like, 'Hey, I look good'. But at the same time, you have to be really careful about putting something into your body.”</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Who is Tammy Slaton dating?

I can’t sit here seeing this'."</p><h2 class=split>Alix Earle credits her TikTok success to her acne</h2><p>"I started posting about my acne," the University of Miami senior explained to Howard during her first appearance on the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Stern Show</a> on Tuesday morning.</p><p>"When I first started, I had no notion, and I was striving to be picture perfect, thinking it was the way to get... "But nothing has ever really worked for me," she admits of starting a TikTok account during her freshman year of college. She made the decision to expose the world to a more vulnerable side of herself. And it was effective. "I wrote about [my acne], and then the fans began to pour in... "Which is crazy because I was trying to be the opposite for three years, and the second I stopped trying to be the hot, pretty, picture-perfect girl, that's when things started to take off," she explained.</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Bella Poarch expresses desire to join basketball team Lakers, Internet asks 'what are you gonna do?'</a></p><p><a href=#>LSU superstar Olivia Dunne amazes Internet with glimpse of her stunning gymnastics performance: 'The talent is crazy'</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRomZyexW6xwKujnmWklrmsv4yamaitpGKvs7HArKtmoZ2luaK606xkmqaUYsGqt4ytpqRlo6qwpLHSrGSopl2ptaZ5x6iumqqUYsC1sdGnZKygn6w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
