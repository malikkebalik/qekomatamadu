In late February 2022, the cast and crew members were spotted taping several important sequences near the Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport at 6000 North Terminal Parkway in Atlanta. Additional portions of the movie were also lensed in and around Eddie’s Attic at 515 North McDonough Street in the city of Decatur.</p><h2>Washington, D.C.</h2><p>Also known as The District, Washington, D.C., served as one of the prominent production locations for ‘Ghosted’ as the team utilized several streets, sites, and neighborhoods to tape the film. It is likely that a few sequences were shot at the mixed-use development of The Wharf and the neighborhood of Georgetown.</p><p>Moreover, the Lincoln book tower inside Ford’s Theatre at 511 10th Street Northwest, the National Gallery of Art’s West building dome located between 3rd and 9th Streets at Constitution Avenue Northwest, the Exorcist Steps at Georgetown University, and Wharf Jitney – Recreation Pier, all in Washington, D.C., also make an appearance in the movie.</p><p>Several other exterior scenes for ‘Ghosted’ were taped across different streets in the capital city; they include Maryland Avenue Northeast, Independence Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue, Madison Drive Northwest, Thomas Jefferson Street Northwest, and M Street Northwest.</p><h2>London, England</h2><p>For shooting purposes, the cast and crew of ‘Ghosted’ also traveled to London as they shot many scenes between Cole and Sadie when the former visits the capital of England in the movie to get in touch with Sadie again. You can spot the iconic Big Ben and the Tower Bridge in several sequences while Cole looks for Sadie.</p><p>Some pivotal sequences were also recorded in and around The Vault 1894 pub, which is tucked under the Tower Bridge in the historic riverside street of Shad Thames.
