Everything I’ve been going through with every game, every day, every complaint… and it is getting worse,” Vinicius added.</p><p>“The lack of punishments is very frustrating. If we start punishing these people, not that they’ll change their thinking, but they’ll be afraid to speak out, whether it’s in the stadium, where there are cameras… put fear into those people.</p><p>“I want to keep fighting for it, but it’s hard. It doesn’t matter if I win or lose the games, I’m already a winner for being here.”</p><p>By Agencies.</p><b>Email your news TIPS to Editor@kahawatungu.com or WhatsApp +254707482874</b><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmijkZ2uuK3TrqWgrV6YvK57wauYs6GcqHq3tc2imqKto2K3s3nSmrCsZaKWsKq%2F02aYm62jmnqquoysp5qhnmK1or%2BMrZiknZ5it7DFjKisrWWfm3qnu86tmZqknGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
