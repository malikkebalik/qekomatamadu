Per the show’s theme song, Caillou enjoys exploring his fictional world on Pine Street along with his parents, friends, grandparents, pets and puppet pals. The show included segments to teach young ones how to brush their teeth, the days of the week, and how to work through temper tantrums and sibling squabbles, which the titular character apparently struggled with throughout the five seasons the show aired.&nbsp;</p><p>“Growing up is not so tough, ‘cept when I’ve had enough,” sings Caillou in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">show’s theme song sequence,</a> which shows the tot throwing toys and beating his fists on the bathroom floors. Videos circulating online show Caillou <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pinching his baby sister Rosie</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">whining to his mother</a>. Some parents admit that Caillou’s bad behavior on-screen caused them to ban the Canadian series from their home.&nbsp;</p><p>“This is the one show he wasn’t allowed to watch,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote one mother</a>. Another PBS-reared adult reminisced, “This show was banned in my house and many of my friends!”</p><p>Caillou was not without his professional critics either. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One op-ed </a>from Canadian newspaper the National Post categorized Caillou as a “shameless whiner,” adding that the toon, “turn[s] the show’s young viewers into shrill monsters.”</p><p>With the cancellation kicking off 2021, parents are relieved to see that Caillou is finally getting the punishment <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">they believe he deserved</a> all along.</p><p>Caillou passes the torch to a few more recent and more popular PBS cartoon characters including Daniel the Tiger, a former supporting character from “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood”; Pinkalicious, the co-star of “Pinkalicious & Peterrific”; and Molly, a 10-year-old Alaska-native protagonist of “Molly of Denali.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3J7j2pmaW5fpa6zsc2tqmabn6q5pbrTZpmeZZiWvbG1xKtkraCRqXqkrcilo6itXZ7Abq%2FAp5qepJyasXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
