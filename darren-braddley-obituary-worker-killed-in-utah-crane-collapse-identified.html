The accident occurred at the construction site of the new bridge. Sgt. Brian Peterson of the Utah Highway Patrol identified Darren Braddley, 42 years old, a resident of Gunnison, as the person they believe to be responsible for the crime. There was no prompt delivery of additional information pertaining to Bradley.</p><p>The incident occurred early on Monday morning as technicians were disassembling the crane in Farmington along a portion of the West Davis Corridor that is being constructed over the Interstate 15. According to the crews, the man was injured when a piece of the crane fell on him while they were in the process of disassembling the crane. Other workers were let go for the remainder of the workday and sent home after the incident occurred. The authorities were informed that there were no other fatalities that occurred. The Utah Highway Patrol is the agency that is leading the investigation at this time.</p><p>UDOT is also conducting their own investigations at this time. According to Gleason, the investigation will involve a thorough examination of the safety protocols that are adhered to by UDOT. “We will be looking into what exactly happened with this construction incident that caused the fatality, and we will also be reviewing all of our policies,” said the president. As a result of the probe, the project, which has been under way since the year 2021, has been put on hold for the time being. At the start of Tuesday’s workday, the related crane could still be seen at the location where the construction was taking place.</p>0<span class=mashsb-sharetext>SHARES</span><a class="mashicon-facebook mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Share</span></a><a class="mashicon-twitter mash-large mash-center mashsb-noshadow" href=# rel=nofollow><span class=icon></span><span class=text>Tweet</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmihnqG8t7XNoKSepZ%2Bntqa%2FzZ6urGaTpLpwsMCrqZ6mXZe%2ForDDpZyyZZ%2BXtrXBwKuwZq%2Bfp7imvoykoKWklZl6qrqMrquaoF2Yv6K6xGaaqKSclr20sYyim56mpJ6zqrHDaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
